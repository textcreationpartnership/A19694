         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of many defects
in diſcharge of
my dutie which
God required at
my hands toward you, (which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beſeech the Lord and you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,)
yet this hath beene, is, and I
hope ſhall be, to the end of my dayes,
my comfort, that I haue not laboured
in vaine amongſt you. What were my
labours and ſucceſſe thereof, I muſt
<pb facs="tcp:29133:3"/>
appeale to the conſciences of you who
are yet liuing; for you know that not
a few are now at reſt with the Lord,
whoſe holy liues and happy ends gaue
good teſtimony hereof. But to leaue
theſe to the wiſe conſideration, of ſuch
whom they may concerne, and to giue
vnto all, to whom theſe preſents ſhall
come, a iuſt account of my proceedings
herein: I doe profeſſe that for many
yeares paſt, I haue had my thoughts
much exerciſed about this prime grace
of Faith; (by which alone we receiue
all ſauing grace, and without which
none:) and after that, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I found through conference with
many of diuers ſorts, that very few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the true knowledge, much
leſſe to the right vſe of Faith, either in
the aſſurance of their ſaluation, or well
ordering of their conuerſation. For to
paſſe ouer all carnall Proteſtants, who
only <hi>haue a forme of godlineſſe,</hi> making
an outward ſhew thereof, <hi>and deny the
power of it,</hi> in walking after their owne
luſts: I haue obſerued very many, who
haue in truth laboured after ſaluation,
yet through want of good direction
haue made forſaking of their ſinne, the
ground of their beleeuing, and ſo buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſuch a weightie matter, vpon ſo
weake a foundation, could neuer come
to ſuch certaintie of their ſaluation, or
<pb facs="tcp:29133:3"/>
conſtancie in a holy conuerſation, as
true Faith would haue brought them
vnto. Some others I haue ſeene, who
being deeply affected with the ſenſe of
their miſery, and knowing that there is
no meanes of recouery, but by Chriſt,
haue deſired nothing more, then to be
deliuered, and reſtored by him; yet
theſe not knowing the right way how
to attaine to Faith, by which alone
doe receiue Chriſt and all his benefits)

peace and comfort, which a liuely Faith
would certainly procure. By all which
it appeareth, how few they be that haue

               </gap>ten and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and how to liue by it. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whereof grieuing my ſoule
to ſee ſo many miſtaken in ſo weightie
a matter, and ſo much labour to be loſt,
hath been the chiefe moouer of me, to
imploy all my thoughts, how this great
euill may be redreſſed. Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into deeper conſideration, how
this might be attained, I well perceiued,
<pb facs="tcp:29133:4"/>
that (ſeeing Gods truth reuealed vnto
vs in his Word, is the ſole ground of
Faith,) the only way to get and keepe
Faith, is to bee well acquainted with
Gods Word, in which I cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
admire the wiſedome and loue
of God; in prouiding ſuch ſtore of
heauenly comforts, to releeue vs in all
our neceſſities: ſo that had wee the
knowledge, and the right vſe of them,
we ſhould then ſee, what were the Life
of Faith, and the bleſſed eſtate of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
in this world, aboue all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
though neuer ſo excellent. Theſe
thus being, I gaue my ſelfe to the ſearch
of the Scriptures, to finde out what
theſe heauenly comforts were, which
God hath ſo abundantly prouided
for our reliefe, in all time of neede.
And to this purpoſe, (with no ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
haue gathered out all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as well as I could out of both the
Teſtaments, which being laide toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made a great heape of heauenly
treaſure, ſuch as any of vnderſtanding,
would greatly admire and reioyce in
and I may in truth profeſſe, I was much
affected with the bare reading of them.
But well conſidering, that the naked
laying downe of theſe promiſes, would
not be ſufficient to direct euery one, to
the right vſe and fit application of
them, for the begetting and increaſing
of Faith:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29133:4"/>
I haue laboured to draw theſe vnto
ſeuerall heads, ſuch as in my opinion
may containe all our neceſſities, that
at leaſtwiſe the weakeſt ſort may more
fitly apply them to their ſeuerall vſes,
and ſo by Faith be comforted, when all
other helpes faile them. If in this my
labour I haue not ſo ſufficiently ſatisfied
the deſires of the moſt iudicious: I muſt
content my ſelfe, that according to the
meaſure of grace receiued, I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to be helpfull to ſuch as ſtand
in neede hereof; and haue carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided,
whatſoeuer I haue thought
might hinder their profiting, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
all controuerſies about Faith, and
haue plainly ſhewed out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
what I haue conceiued to be the
truth; wherein I may haue this defence
of my failing, that I haue not had any
guide in this labour, neither haue I
ſeene any who haue in this way gone
before me; and therefore I entreate, my
<hi>Reuerend</hi> brethren in the Miniſterie,
whoſe abilities doe farre exceede mine,
that they would perfect this, which is
but weakely begun. And for my part,
I will not ceaſe to pray, that this may be
as profitable to others, as painfull to
my ſelfe, which the Lord grant, for his
Chriſts ſake.</p>

of a holy life, vvhich vvits-leſſe
exerciſed of themſelues, would not ſo vvell
haue diſcerned.</p>
            <p>For the benefiting by vvhich Treatiſe, it
vvill not bee inconuenient to know theſe
<pb facs="tcp:29133:7"/>
foure things. Firſt, that it ſuppoſeth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grounded in the knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and properties of God, of Chriſt and his
offices, of the couenant of grace and ſuch
like; becauſe as in an arch one ſtone ſettles
an other, ſo there is ſuch a linking together
of points in diuinitie, that one ſtrengtheneth
another. For from vvhence, hath Faith
that efficacie, but becauſe it is that which
is required in the couenant, to lay hold on
the free promiſe? And vvhence haue the
promiſes their ſtrength but from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
nature of Iehoua, who giueth a being
to his Word, and is at peace with vs by the
all-fufficient ſacrifice of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of the new couenant? Words haue their
validity from the authoritie of the ſpeaker:
were not faith founded on the word of an
infinite God ſo throughly appeaſed, the
ſoule would ſinke in great temptations,
whereas now euen mountaines vaniſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a beleeuing ſoule. For what is all to
Chriſt, and vvho is able to ſubdue all to
himſelfe? Hence it is that now we are by
Faith ſafer then <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we haue a promiſe which he wanted.
Safer it is to be as low as hell with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
then as high in Paradiſe without it,
becauſe Faith wrought by the power of
God, hath what ſtrength God hath on
whom it reſteth, and therefore worketh ſuch
wonders.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer the knowledge of theſe
things ſerueth the argument in hand, yet it
<pb facs="tcp:29133:7"/>
muſt not be expected, that hee ſhould bee
long in theſe things which are but coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and ſhould be foreknowne: which I
ſpeake, becauſe ſome of weaker iudgement
not conſidering the iuſt bounds of Treatiſes
may expect larger handling of ſome things.
Whereas he hath laboured eſpecially to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the argument in hand and not to load
the diſcourſe. In the ſecond place, it muſt
be knowne that the fruit of theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to ſuch as are in Chriſt, in whom all
promiſes are yea and Amen, made and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
Hee that by the immortall ſeed of
the Word and Spirit is borne againe, may
claime a title to that he is borne vnto. For
cleering of this there be three degrees of
promiſes, one of ſaluation to abſolute and
perſonall obedience, but this by reaſon of
weakeneſſe of the fleſh driueth vs to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
in our ſelues, and ſo to the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of life by Chriſt: This requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but receiuing by Faith, which is
wrought in thoſe that are giuen to Christ,
whilſt grace is offered, the Spirit cloathing
the words with a hidden and ſtrong power,
and making them operatiue; when they are
commanded to beleeue, their hearts are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to beleeue. To perſons in this ſtate are
made a third kinde of promiſes of all that
is needfull in this world, vntill all promiſes,
end in performance; of both theſe promiſes
and the laſt eſpecially this book ſpeaketh of.
Thirdly, it muſt be preſſed vpon thoſe that
meane to profit, that they reſolue to come
<pb facs="tcp:29133:8"/>
vnder Chriſts gouernment, and be willing
to be ledde by the Spirit into all reuealed
truth. Wiſedome is eaſie to ſuch as are
willing, and the victorie is as good as got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
when the will is brought from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to baſe affections, to reſolue to bee
guided; for ſuch a heart lyeth open to Gods
gracious working, and the Spirit readily
cloſeth with ſuch a ſpirit as putteth not
barres of obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, We muſt know in the
fourth place, that when we are at the beſt,
we ſhall yet be in ſuch a conflicting ſtate, as
that we ſhall long after that glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the ſonnes of God, after we haue done
the worke God hath giuen vs to doe. For,
God will haue a difference betwixt heauen
and earth, and ſharpen our deſire of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his kingdome, which nothing doth
ſo much, eſpecially in times of outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie,
as thoſe tedious combates of the
inner man; and yet let this raiſe vp our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that it is ſo farre, that this remainder
ſhould preiudice our intereſt in happineſſe,
that thereby we are driuen euery day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our claime to the promiſe of pardon,
and ſo to liue by Faith, vntill this vncleane
iſſue be dried vp. Theſe ſowre hearbs helpe
vs to reliſh Chriſt the better. Moreouer,
though in this life our endeauours come
ſhort of our deſires, and we alwaies allow a
greater meaſure then we can attaine vnto:
yet we may by ſtirring vp the graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in vs, and by ſuing God vpon thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:29133:8"/>
promiſes of his Spirit and Grace, whereby
he hath made himſelfe a debter vnto vs,
come to that meaſure whereby wee ſhall
make the profeſsion of religion glorious, and
louely in the eyes of others, and comfortable
to our ſelues: and ſo ſhine farre brighter
then others doe. Why then doe we not in the
vſe of all ſanctified meanes begge of God,
to make good the promiſes wherein he hath
cauſed vs to truſt? Doe we not beſide life
of our bodies, deſire health and ſtrength, to
diſcharge all the offices of ciuill life! and
why ſhould we not much more (if the life
of God be in vs) labour after health and
vigor of ſpirit, and for that annointing of
the holy Ghoſt, whereby we may doe and
ſuffer all things, ſo as we may draw others
to a liking of our waies? The truth is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
laboureth to keepe vs vnder vnbeleefe
of particular promiſes, and from renewing
our couenant, in confidence that God will
perfect the worke that he hath begun, and
not repent him of his earnest. So farre as
thus we cheriſh diſtruſt, we lie open to Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan.
Strengthen Faith, and ſtrengthen all.
Let vs therefore at once ſet vpon all duties
required, and be in loue with an holy life,
aboue all other liues, and put our ſelues
vpon Gods mercy and truth; and we ſhall
be able from experience ſo farre to iuſtifie
all Gods waies, as that wee would not bee
in another ſtate for all the world. What
greater encouragement can we wiſh, then
that our corruptions ſhall fall more and
<pb facs="tcp:29133:9"/>
more before the Spirit: and we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe all things through Chriſt that
ſtrengthneth vs.</p>
            <p>To make theſe waies of God more plaine
vnto vs, this paines is taken by this man
of God. Not to diſparage the labours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holy men, (as far as I can iudge) there
is nothing in this kinde more fully, indici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
&amp; ſauorily written, with greater eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Spirit, perſwaded of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and truth of what it ſets downe: And
(though diſtinct from reſpect to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
the Treatiſe deſerueth much reſpect,
yet it ſhould gaine the move acceptance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of thoſe that are babes and yong
men in Christ, that it is written by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of long and Reuerend eſteeme in the
Church: who hath begunne in all theſe
rules to others. As for our bodies, ſo for
our ſoules, wee may more ſecurely rely
on an olde experienced Phyſition. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
it vnto thee, hauing felt the
kindly working of it, vpon himſelfe.
The Lord by his Spirit conuey theſe truths
into thy heart, and vppon good felt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in thy ſoule, remember to deſire God
that he may ſtill bring forth more fruite
in his age vntill hee hath finiſhed his

aſsured hope of a bleſſed charge.</p>

Treatiſe is fit to be vnder taken by a
man well exerciſed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and well acquainted with the
diſpoſition of mans heart towards
theſe promiſes. Such an one is he who
hath penned and publiſhed this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
His exerciſe in the Scripture
hath enabled him to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heapes of promiſes. His expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the diſpoſition of mans
heart, (hauing piercingly diued
thereinto through much friendly
and familiar conference with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ſorts) hath enabled him to ſet
thoſe heapes in a fitte and due order.
What I ſay of him, I know of him;
for from mine infancy haue I known
him, and vnder his miniſtery was I
trained vp in my younger yeares: hee
being at the leaſt two and twenty
yeares elder then my ſelfe. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:29133:11"/>
of all the Miniſters that euer
I knew, he hath been one of the moſt
painfull, faithfull, and powerfull,
giue me leaue (good Reader) to ſet
downe ſomewhat of his practiſe for
a patterne to others. What manner
of entring vpon his paſtorall charge,
he had, is not vnknowne to them
that were vnder his charge. Very
few, if any at all, did hee finde fit to
receiue the holy Communion: which
mooued him by the ſpace of many
moneths from morning to night, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day in the weeke to inſtruct in
the firſt oracles of the word of God,
euery one vnder his charge, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one by one ſeuerally, and other
times many ioyntly together: which
he did with ſuch ſucceſſe, as there
were but few that were not able to
giue a reaſon of their hope to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and ſo were admitted to the
Lords Table. From which time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
after, ſo long as hee continued
there, he had weekly meetings in his
Church for all ſorts, distinctly on
ſeuerall daies to catechiſe them in
<pb facs="tcp:29133:12"/>
the Principles of Religion: whereby
(I am perſwaded) he did more good
then by preaching, which yet was
very powerfull, and not in vaine. For
as his owne, and his hearers labours,
in teaching and learning abounded,
ſo God gaue anſwerable fruits in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the word. For as the
Lords day was very religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:
ſo the foule ſins, whereunto
people vntaught are vſually giuen,
were there abandoned, &amp; all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among neighbours ſo laid aſide,
as moſt louingly they came to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
houſe. And though there
were many poore, and none greatly
rich, yet did none of the poore begge
abroad for food, but were releeued at
home. Among other euidences of the
power of Gods word among them, I
will record one, a very remarkeable
one, and worthy to bee had in more
frequent vſe. It was this: In time of
great dearth of corn and other food,
there was order taken by publike
authority, that euery family ſhould
forbeare one meale in the weeke, and
<pb facs="tcp:29133:12"/>
vpon the Lords day bring the value
of it to the collectours for the poore.
This being faithfully performed by
them all, therewith they did prouide
good corne, which coſt 8. or 9. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
the buſhell, and ſolde it to the
poore at 12. pence the pecke, and yet
reſerueda good ſtock to ſet the poore
on worke. Theſe and many other
good works were done vnder his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
who was ready on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to preſſe the doctrine of faith: ſo
as the preaching of faith hindereth
not the performance of good works.
This Treatiſe will giue euident
proofe thereof. Well vſe his paines,
and thou ſhait not loſe thy paines.</p>

in this world which God their

were not the fault in themſelues.</p>
            <p>The truth hereof may appeare
in theſe two things eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that ſo few doe hold faſt

of this world, or in patient
bearing the manifold troubles of

portion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſo few doe caſt

they be not many euen of thoſe

that certainty of their ſaluation,

            <p>To proue theſe to be ſo, is not

            <p>The conſideration of theſe,
hath oft and long moued mee to

whereof is this, that the man

as he firſt was made aliue by the

            <p>All which are moſt ſufficiently
by the Apoſtle drawne to foure

               <hi>But,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30</note> yee are of him in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
who of God is made to vs wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and righteouſneſſe, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

1. Firſt,<note place="margin">2 Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that the Wiſdome,
Iuſtification, Sanctification, and
Redemption, whereby any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
naturally fooliſh, guiltie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
and in bondage, is made
wiſe, iuſtified, ſanctified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
is all &amp; alone in Chriſt,
who is made of God vnto vs all
of theſe; that is, hee himſelfe
wrought all theſe things for vs,
and giues them freely to vs, and
no other way can any man haue
any of theſe, but from and in
Chriſt,<note place="margin">We haue all grace in Chriſt.</note> as is expreſſely ſaid in the
firſt words of this verſe, where it
is ſaid, that <hi>yee are of him,</hi> that
is of God <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> that is
made by God one with Chriſt,
ſet into him (by faith,) as ſhall
in the ſecond generall point bee
ſhewed.</p>
            <p>the other ſpeciall point,<note place="margin">2 Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which
I thinke meet in this forenamed
Scripture to bee obſerued is
this.<note place="margin">Many ſeek to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt not to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That whereas all who look to
be ſaued by Chriſt in all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29133:17"/>
of their conſcience for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſinne, doe runne to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for pardon of their ſinne:
yet many of them being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by their corrupt nature,
and ſo falling into ſinne, doe
pray to God for more grace to
mortifie the ſame, and doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and ſtriue to maſter it (both
which muſt be done) but theſe
men not ſo cleerely ſeeing, that
all power to mortifie all ſinne,
and to practiſe all good duties,
lieth onely in Chriſt, and muſt
from him be receiued by vs; that
ſo we may preuaile, herein they
faile, that not receiuing this
power from Chriſt, nor well
knowing how, doe loſe much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and in long time get ſmall
victorie; yea, rather many times
their corruptions get ſtrength
ouer them.</p>
            <p>The chiefe remedie of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
I take to be this, that as wee
obtaine pardon of ſinne, and be
iuſtified by applying Chriſt vnto
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29133:18"/>
our ſelues: ſo we in like manner
muſt apply Chriſt vnto our
ſelues for our ſanctification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more able to purge our
ſelues then to iuſtifie our ſelues.</p>
            <p>This is liuely repreſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs by the parable of the Vine
and the branches,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 5.</note> that as the
branch receiues all ſap whereby
it is fruitfull, from the Vine, ſo
doe we from Chriſt; therefore
hee himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 2: 20.</note> 
               <hi>(without me ye
can doe nothing)</hi> and to like effect
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainely,
<hi>neuertheleſſe I liue, yet not I, but
Chriſt liueth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon hereof is as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that mans nature beeing ſo
wholly corrupted, that hee hath
no inclination, much leſſe ability
to doe Gods will, Chriſt taking
mans nature hath ſo ſanctified it
in his owne perſon, that it is able
perfectly to pleaſe God, which
puritie of his nature being in
ſome meaſure communicated to
vs ſinners,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18</note> we are <hi>changed into the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29133:18"/>
ſame Image fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glory to glory, euen
as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> which
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth to bee
<hi>partakers of the Diuine nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> By
all which and the like many, it is
euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that as all our comfort for
our full &amp; free Iuſtification muſt
be had from and in Chriſt alone,
ſo all the power whereby wee
may mortifie our corruptions,
and performe all holy duties ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Chriſt alone, and muſt bee
had in and from him. And thus
much for the former generall
point, that all grace we want is in
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond that
Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. Of faith.</note> and all grace in him, is
receiued by faith, <hi>Wee are well to
weigh the nature of this faith, what
it is, and how it is gotten and kept:</hi>
that ſo we may liue by it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this is to bee remembred, that
in this buſineſſe, we haue nothing
to doe, but with a true ſauing
faith, which is vſually termed a
Iuſtifying faith,<note place="margin">How iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> not for that it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29133:19"/>
doth properly for any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in it ſelfe, or by any effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in it, make righteous, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that as a weake hand it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
Chriſt our righteouſnes,
who hath fully wrought all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
for vs, and freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
it on all thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him by this hand of Faith.
Now then to ſay what this Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Faith is, howſoeuer many
learned Diuines haue diuerſly
defined or deſcribed it; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the whole nature of it, may
thus be ſufficiently ſet forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs.</p>
            <p>Iuſtifying Faith is a beliefe of
the Goſpell,<note place="margin">What Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith is.</note> wherby I receiue Chriſt
offered to me in the ſame.</p>
            <p>This is plainely to bee ſeene in
this Scripture, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Iohn 1. 12. But as many as
receiued him, to them hee gaue
power to be the ſonnes of God, euen
to them that beleeued on his name.</hi>
Which I deſire may be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
for that ſo many bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29133:19"/>
in this matter of Faith
and that diuerſly: who all by the
light of truth may bee drawne
into the right way, and ſo finde
that ſweet and precious fruit of
Faith, which ſo few attaine vnto.
For the better vnderſtanding
whereof, we are to obſerue two
ſpeciall points pertaining to the
nature of this Iuſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, what it hath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with all other kindes of faith.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly what in ſpeciall,
whereby it differeth from them all.</p>
            <p>For the former,<note place="margin">Faith is a beliefe.</note> I call it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
which is a giuing credit to
that which is ſpoken, whereby a
man is aſſured that it is true
which is ſpoken; which aſſurance
may be more or leſſe, according
to the perſwaſion we haue of the
truth of the ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">What is to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> the matter the bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
is here ſaid to be the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>That is,<note place="margin">Goſpell.</note> the glad tydings of
of reconciliation made by Chriſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29133:20"/>
Ieſus betweene God and man,
which though it be diuerſly, and
in ſundry ſpeeches ſet out vnto
vs in holy Scriptures, yet all is
moſt ſufficiently contained in
this one ſentence deliuered by
Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. For
God ſo loued the world, that he gaue
his onely begotten Sonne, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
beleeueth in him, ſhould not
periſh, but haue euerlaſting life;</hi>
wherein this is euident that the
matter to be beleeued vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this.</p>
            <p>That God the father mooued
by nothing but his free loue to
mankinde loſt, hath made a deed
of gift and grant of his Sonne
Chriſt Ieſus vnto mankinde, that
whoſoeuer of all mankinde ſhall
receiue this gift by a true and
liuely faith, hee ſhall not periſh,
but haue euerlaſting life, which
the ſame Apoſtle expreſly ſaith,
1. <hi>Ioh. 5. 11. This is the record,
that God hath giuen to vs eternall
life, and this life is in his Sonne,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:29133:20"/>
meaning, that this it is, which
God hath witneſſed for vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
which <hi>hee that doth not,
makes God a lyar;</hi> and ſhall moſt
iuſtly be condemned; therefore
this then is the firſt thing in true
faith to be conſidered, that euery
ſoule to whom God ſendeth this
meſſage of the Goſpell doe true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue and giue credit vnto
it to bee true, that God hath
made grant of Chriſt to ſinners,
ſo that if he accept this grant, he
ſhall bee ſaued. This is that faith
which in ſchooles is called hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall,
becauſe it goeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to giue aſſent and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to the ſtory of that which
God ſpeaketh to be true, which
one may beleeue for another;
and therefore this cannot be true
iuſtifying faith, and this may be
in thoſe that knowe they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to the wedding, yet refuſe to
come. So that though this bee
neceſſary to true iuſtifying faith,
yet it is not ſufficient: therfore in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29133:21"/>
iuſtifying faith there is required
another and more ſpeciall work;
namely, <hi>to receiue Chriſt, and life
in him offered in the Gospell,</hi> which
was the ſecond generall point to
bee conſidered in the nature of
this iuſtifying faith. Namely,
that beſide the aſſent of the mind
and iudgment to the truth of the
Goſpell,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſpeciall worke of faith, is to receiue Chriſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs in the Goſpell.</note> wee giue conſent with
our heart and will, and ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and gladly accept Gods gift
of Chriſt, whereby indeede he is
become ours, and we his: and ſo
we in him <hi>be made partakers of all
things pertaining to life and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 3.</note>
as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
where I would haue this
ſpecially to be marked, that hee
ſaith, this is by the knowledge
or acknowledging of him, which
I vnderſtand to be by true faith,
whereby we know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Chriſt to be ours.</p>
            <p>This I the rather obſerue, for
that I ſee ſome honeſtly minded,
herein beguiled, to imagine that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29133:21"/>
a man may be a true member of
Chriſt, and ſo be iuſtified, before
he thus actually beleeue, and
thereby apprehend Chriſt. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but that ſome weake in
faith may feare that they do not
beleeue, and that they haue not
apprehended Chriſt when in
deede they haue apprehended
him, though they feele it not;
who may be diſcerned partly by
their heauineſſe for want of ſenſe
of faith, but eſpecially by their
loue they beare to God ſhewed
manifold waies, whereof we ſhall
here more in the triall of faith.</p>
            <p>But that he who neuer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
Chriſt by beleeuing,
ſhould ordinarily bee a member
of Chriſt, I cannot ſee; ſure I
am, the Scripture conſtantly
ſpeaketh otherwiſe, as <hi>Iohn 12.
As many as receiued him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3 26.</note> 
               <hi>to them
hee gaue power to bee the ſonnes of
God, euen to them that beleeue in his
name.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> And to like effect often,
that <hi>we are all the children of God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29133:22"/>
by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, That wee
liue by faith of the Sonne of God,
That Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts
by faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In which and the like many,
it is euident that faith is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
whereby wee receiue
Chriſt our righteouſnes and life.
And this is the conſtant opinion
of all found Diuines ſo farre as I
know.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature of faith conſiſteth in
the true acceptation of Chriſt
proclaimed in the Goſpell.<note place="margin">How faith is gotten.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now followeth to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how this faith is to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and increaſed, that ſo we may
liue by it, wherein wee haue theſe
two points to be obſerued.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt,<note place="margin">2. point.</note> what is the ground of
faith?<note place="margin">1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> how faithis hereon
builded.</p>
            <p>But before, this blocke (at
which ſo many ſtumble) is to be
remooued, That wee yet ſpeake
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29133:22"/>
not how a man that hath faith
may know it to bee ſo (whereof
more in his place) but how one
that indeede hath not <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Chriſt by faith may attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</hi> So that here onely we ſeeke
the cauſes which beget this faith,
not the effects of faith, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prooue we haue it.</p>
            <p>Many not diſcerning this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
doe much miſtake,<note place="margin">Cauſes and effects of faith diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> and
being asked what cauſed them to
beleeue, they ſay, becauſe they
haue truely repented, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their courſe of life, which if
it proceede not from faith, is not
ſo much as a ſound proofe of
faith, much leſſe can it bee any
cauſe to drawe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,</p>
            <p>By which miſtaking it comes
to paſſe, that ſuch perſons buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their faith vpon their life,
(which is ſubiect to many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
can neuer haue ſound and
ſtedfaſt faith) but a ſtaggering &amp;
vnconſtant opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the beſt. We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29133:23"/>
haue neede therefore to looke
for a more ſure ground whereon
to build our faith, which muſt
ſtand againſt ſo many and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtormes wherewith it is ſo vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>The onely firme ground of
this ſauing faith is Gods truth
reuealed in his word,<note place="margin">The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground of faith is Gods truth, Reaſon why.</note> as is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught, <hi>Rom. 10. 17. So then faith
cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the word of God.</hi> And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is ſaide of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
1. 13. That they by hearing
the word of truth, the Gospell of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
beleeued,</hi> which is as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to reaſon, in that there is not
any thing in heauen or in earth,
which can teſtifie to vs ſuch good
will in God to ſaue vs; but wee
muſt haue Gods owne word to
witneſſe this vnto vs, and all lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
enough. It is a matter ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that the holy and iuſt
God who cannot abide any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2.</note>
but will certainely giue
to euery ſinne his due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29133:23"/>
yet of his owne free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hath giuen and granted to
poore ſinners eternall life.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath the Lord ſo
often, and ſo euidently ſpoken
no leſſe, that hee might thereby
mooue vs to beleeue, as 1. <hi>Ioh. 5.
11.</hi> expreſly affirming. This is
that which is teſtified, <hi>That God
hath giuen vs eternall life; and this
life is in his ſonne.</hi> For our further
confirmation wherein, it is ſaide,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 7. that this is witneſſed both
<hi>by three witneſſes in heauen.</hi> The
firſt, <hi>the father;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>the
word:</hi> that is, <hi>the ſonne of God,
the ſecond perſon in Trinity;</hi> the
third, <hi>the holy Ghoſt which three
be one diuine</hi> nature, and teſtifie
the ſame things; as alſo by three
witneſſes on earth, all which be
in euery true beleeuer, and none
els. The firſt, <hi>the ſpirit;</hi> the ſecond,
<hi>the water;</hi> the third, <hi>the blood
which agree in one, witneſſing the
ſame</hi> things, wherby are meant. By
the firſt, our ſpirit; by the ſecond,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29133:24"/>
our ſanctification; &amp; by the third,
our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in the mouth
of ſo many witneſſes, this truth
which of al others is the greateſt
(yet moſt hardly receiued) may
ſtand ſure for the conſolation of
all beleeuers, and conviction of
all vnbeleeuers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which is further added,</hi>
verſ. 10. Hee that beleeueth in the
Sonne of God, hath the witneſſe in
himſelfe, he that beleeueth not, God
hath made him a lyar, becauſe hee
beleeued not the record which God
witneſſeth of his ſonne.</p>
            <p>The ſelfe ſame word of life is
in ſundry other Scriptures pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
vnto vs; becauſe the Lord
knoweth we haue neede to heare
of it continually; wee are ſo
full of doubting in time of
temptation: therefore our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himſelfe proclaimeth this
glad tydings. <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. For God
ſo loued the world; that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
his onely begotten ſonne, that
whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29133:24"/>
not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life;</hi>
and <hi>verſe 17. For God ſent not his
Sonne into the world to condemne
the world, but that the world
through him might bee ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So likewiſe</hi> Ioh. 12 47. I came
not to condemne the world, but to
ſaue the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe,</hi> Ioh. 2. 2. If any man
ſinne, we haue an aduocate with the
father Ieſus Chriſt the Iuſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.
And he is the reconciliation for
our ſinnes, and not for ours only, but
for the ſinnes of the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Ioh. 1. 29. Behold the lambe
of God which taketh away the ſins
of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So the Apoſtle ſaith.</hi> 2. Cor. 5.
19. For God was in Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the world vnto himſelfe, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
their ſinnes vnto them, and
hath committed to vs the word of
reconciliation.</p>
            <p>In all which and many other
Scriptures, this is manifeſt, that
God in his word hath made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
offer of ſaluation in Chriſt,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29133:25"/>
and inuiteth all (to whom hee
ſendeth his ſeruants, the preachers
of his Goſpell) to come to Chriſt
that they might bee ſaued, as is
plaine in the parable of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1. which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called the Goſpell, that is
good newes: becauſe it bringeth
foorth this glad tydings of <hi>great
ioye that ſhall be to all people,</hi> as the
Angels of the Lord tolde that
the ſheepheards of the birth of
Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſame which our
Lord Ieſus himſelfe after hee had
finiſhed his whole work of mans
redemption here on earth, and
was to aſcend vp to his father to
prepare a place for all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
commanded his Apoſtles,
and ſo conſequently gaue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
to al their ſucceſſours, the
preachers of the Goſpell, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
and <hi>publiſh this Goſpell to
euery creature:</hi> that is, to euery
man and woman, that ſo euery
ſoule, to whom the ſound of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29133:25"/>
Goſpell ſhould come, might
haue ſufficient ground whereon
to build their faith and be ſaued,
or be made without excuſe <hi>for
neglecting ſo great ſaluation, which
at the firſt began to bee preached by
the Lord, and afterward was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by vs that heard him, Heb.
2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 3. This then is the only ground
whereon ſauing faith is builded.</p>
            <p>Namely, this generall pardon
proclaimed in the Goſpell to
poore ſinners, which I haue very

ſo on the other ſide,
there is no ſinne which ought to

for that Chriſt ſhall haue greater

As a Phyſition ſhall haue more

which ſcriptures and many the

that thereby they may be drawn

wherunto if one thing be added,
I ſee not what can be wanting, to

            <p>This one thing I meane,<note place="margin">Gods truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Gods truth and faithfulneſſe in

(as before I ſpake of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
it is confeſſed of all, that
God is both faithfull and iuſt in

more common then in time of

will not be as good as his word,
at leaſt whatſoeuer is ſaid wee
feare wee ſhall periſh; We need
not ſeeke for proofe hereof,
which is ſo recorded in the liues
of the moſt worthy ſeruants of

            <p>To paſſe by all others, and to

who know and deſire Chriſt;
yea more, who haue heard and
in generall beleeued the Goſpell,
that it is the glad tydings of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that Chriſt bids al that be
heauie laden to come vnto him,
and hee will eaſe them? what is
the cauſe I ſay, that ſo few of
theſe doe ſo laie hold on Gods

aſſured of their ſaluation by

            <p>I know no better anſwer then
this, that when it comes to our

ſome thing or other will bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected

which is ſuch, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p>That ſo oft as doubts ariſe
concerning his ſaluation by

might not periſh but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29133:33"/>
haue euerlaſting life, hee hath no
other thing in the world to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him but this, that God
(who cannot lie) hath ſaid it,
and therefore he may and ought
to beleeue, that Chriſt and all
his benefits are his; wherein the
more to moue him, he is to laie
before him both what a great
ſinne it is not to beleeue, no leſſe
then <hi>to make God a lyer,</hi>

it procureth, euen a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

as our Sauiour himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth.</p>
            <p>By theſe and the like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
is true faith, both firſt
begotten, and afterwards increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all thoſe that ſhall be ſaued,
which I haue more fully laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
not only for that it is the
moſt principall matter to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
concerning true ſauing
faith, namely how he that hath
it not may attaine to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:29133:33"/>
But alſo, for that it is, if not
the leaſt knowne and laboured
for,<note place="margin">Many ſeeke for markes of faith in vaine.</note> yet leaſt attained vnto. For
I haue obſerued many very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiue
for ſome markes of
faith, who neuer ſo much as knew
any thing which might draw
them effectually to beleeue.</p>
            <p>And therefore now to end this
point, concerning the right and
orderly way, whereby an vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
is brought to true and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
faith, my aduiſe is to all
that finde their faith weake, and
conſequently their liues much
out of frame, that firſt they take
good heed whereupon they build
their faith,<note place="margin">Build faith onely on Gods truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and that only vpon
Gods mercy and truth reuealed
in the Goſpell, which neuer
changing are a ſure foundation;
and not vpon their owne change
which oft is deceitfull, and at beſt
variable, and indeed is onely an
effect and fruit of Faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſhewing the ſtrength and
weakeneſſe of our faith, and can
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29133:34"/>
by no meanes be made any cauſe
thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we ſeene both what
this faith is whereby the iuſt doe
liue, and by what meanes it is
attained.</p>
            <p>Now leſt any ſhould gather
out of the former, that any man
may by his owne indeuour, vſing
theſe meanes attaine to faith; I
thinke meet to adde this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be Gods will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to all, to whom hee
ſendeth his Goſpell,<note place="margin">Faith is not in mans power, but wrought by Gods Spirit.</note> that they
ſhould beleeue &amp; receiue Chriſt
offered vnto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is the dutie of euery one
ſo to doe, and it is their ſinne,
and ſhall be their condemnation
who doe not thus, as hath beene
ſaid in all reſpects; yet ſuch is the
corruption of all man-kinde by
<hi>Adams</hi> fall, that not one ſoule
hath either will or power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
this grace in Chriſt offered
vnto him,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32.</note> 
               <hi>For God hath ſhut vp

               <hi>and Faith is the gift of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 44.</note>
               <hi>and none can come to Chriſt except
the Father draw him.</hi> Which is
wiſely diſpoſed by God that no
man might haue cauſe to glory
in himſelfe, but that the glory of
mans ſaluation may bee giuen to
God. From whence it commeth,
that beſides this common fauour
of ſaluation in Chriſt tendred to
all in the Goſpell; yea, &amp; beſides
the common gifts of the Spirit
which many receiue, who neuer
receiued Chriſt by faith. As
knowledge both of mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
&amp; the remedy thereof; ſorrow
for the one, and deſire of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with ſuch others (beſides
theſe I ſay) God doth giue his
holy Spirit to all that ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
who doth inwardly draw
and incline their hearts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
Gods free and gracious
promiſes, and ſo thankfully to
accept Chriſt offered vnto them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29133:35"/>
whereby indeed they bee truely
made partakers of Chriſt and all
his benefites, and thereby bee
iuſtified and ſanctified, and ſhall
be fully and euerlaſtingly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>And thus is a poore ſinner by
Faith made the childe of God,
and heire of glorie. Now before
we proceed to our principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
to ſhew how this Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
man may liue by his faith.
It ſhall not be loſt labour to ſhew
how this may be knowne of any,<note place="margin">How it is knowne a man hath this faith.</note>
that he hath this true faith, and
how euery true beleeuer may be
able to proue that hee doth ſo,
this certaine and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in any man that hee hath
true faith, <hi>Riſeth ioyntly from the
cauſes &amp; effects therof,</hi> &amp; not from
either apart, as ſhall bee ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Vnder the cauſes I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all that worke of God,<note place="margin">Cauſes of faith.</note>
wherby he worketh faith in any,
which ſtandeth eſpecially in
theſe three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:29133:35"/>
1. That God by his word and
Spirit firſt inlighteneth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
truely to conceiue
the doctrine of mans miſerie,
and of his full recouerie by
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, by the ſame
meanes he worketh in his heart,
both ſuch ſound ſorrow for his
miſerie, and feruent deſire after
Chriſt the remedie, that hee can
neuer bee at quiet till hee inioy
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, God ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his loue in freelie offering
Chriſt with all his benefites to
him a poore ſinner, that thereby
he drawes him ſo to giue credit
to God therein, that hee gladly
accepts Chriſt offred vnto him;
Theſe three workes of God,
whoſoeuer findeth to haue beene
wrought in himſelfe, hee may
thereby know certainely hee
hath faith, But without theſe
what change of life ſoeuer may
be conceiued, there can bee no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29133:36"/>
certaintie of faith, and therefore
I againe aduiſe, that this bee firſt
and eſpecially looked vnto for
our comfort, wherein that none
be deceiued with ſhewes of theſe
in ſtead of ſubſtance, I take theſe
to bee true notes of ſoundneſſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt of inlightening
there can be no doubt.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond of ſorrow, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

therefore this ſorrow muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to our liues end, though in
a different manner, now mingled
with comfort, whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
before faith could haue
none.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the other ſide the
ſorrow that quite drieth vp, was
neuer ſound, as it is to bee ſeene
in many, who being once deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afflicted, and in great heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for their miſerable eſtate,
afterward comming to ſome
comfort, are growen ſo ſecure
and ſenſeleſſe, that hauing no

that they were once

            <p>And great reaſon there is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
why all true beleeuers ſhould

more and more thus hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, for the triall of the
third worke of God,<note place="margin">Triall of faith.</note> whereby he
worketh Faith, that any may
know God hath wrought this in
him in deed and in truth, and not
in conceit and opinion (wherein
many be deceiued,) I take this to
be moſt infallible in the weakeſt
of thoſe who may know they
beleeue, that though in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they be driuen from their
hold, yet afterward they returne
vnto their reſt, and finde Gods
holy Spirit drawing them yet to
beleeue in God becauſe of his
word, which though it be weake,
yet it is true faith, and not that
wauering which hath no faith in
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:29133:37"/>
As may bee laid open by a
plaine compariſon for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
ſort. In a paire of gold
weights when they bee emptie,
either ballance will hang waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and not reſt on either ſide:
but if a graine bee put into one
aboue the other, it will weigh it
downe, yet ſo as the winde or a
little iogge may lift it vp; but if
it bee let alone, the graine will
weigh it downe and ſo hold it:
ſo is it betweene weake faith and
wauering. When there is any
credit giuen, and ſo any reſting
on Gods word after temptation,
there is true faith; but where
there is nothing but a hanging in
ſuſpence, and vncertaintie, that is
wauering,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>which cannot looke to
obtaine any thing,</hi> as the Apoſtle
<hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh. Thus by the
cauſes is euery one to trie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
whether true faith haue bin

are the more certaine proofes
though not ſo eaſilie ſeene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:29133:38"/>
Now followe the proofes
taken from the effects and fruits
of faith,<note place="margin">Proofes from effect.</note> which be more manifeſt,
but not ſo certaine, vnleſſe it bee
alſo as manifeſt that they come
from faith.</p>
            <p>To make this plaine to thoſe
for whoſe ſakes I write theſe
(that is, weake beleeuers:) The
principall effects of Faith be Ioy
and Loue, Ioy in the benefit, and
loue to god the author of it. Theſe
bee ſuch as a man may eaſily ſee
whether he hath them in him or
no. But if any man can ſay hee
hath ioy of his ſaluation, and
loues God for it; to ſay nothing
yet of the truth of theſe, vnles he
can proue that theſe grow out of
the tree of Faith; they can no
more proue that hee hath faith,
then fruit growing on one tree,
can proue another tree to bee
good. For we ſhall ſee that both
theſe and many other ſuppoſed
fruits of Faith, are nothing leſſe,
but are baſtard fruits, and meere
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29133:38"/>
naturall affections: I meane ſuch
as may bee in a naturall man not
regenerated, but onlie inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and wrought by ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Spirit as may be in a
reprobate; and therefore neither
theſe nor any other change of
life can bee proofes of faith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it is manifeſt they come
from faith.</p>
            <p>The ignorance of this decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
many who build their faith
on theſe, whereas true fruites
grow from Faith.</p>
            <p>But to come to the triall of
our faith by the effects thereof,<note place="margin">Triall by the Spirit.</note>
which though they be many, yet
may be all contained vnder this
one, of receiuing the Spirit; not
as a ſtranger to doe ſome worke

to imbrace Chriſt, hee ſent
immediatly vpon them his holy

               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 44</note> but afterwards in ordinary

The Spirit is knowne by his

yet in this caſe may well be
contained vnder theſe two, Ioy,
and Loue, (as was before ſaid:)
in regard whereof this grace of
the Spirit is not vnfitly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fire, which hath two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
light and heate; which
though they bee vnſeparable, ſo
that where fire is both theſe
muſt needs bee, yet they are not
both alike ſenſible; for oft the
heare of fire may bee felt when
no light can be ſeene: ſo is it with
theſe of Ioy &amp; Loue, eſpecially in
weak beleeuers; who though their
faith bee ſo couered vnder their
corruptions, that they cannot oft
times haue ſuch ſight thereof
as might breed ioy and comfort
in their ſaluation, yet their loue
to God can neuer bee ſo quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
that they ſhal feele no heate
in it. But if they ſhall bee well
tried what hearts they beare to
God, it cannot bee hid, but they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29133:40"/>
beare a louing affection to him,
approuing of all that he doth to
be well done; yea, though hee
ſhould condemne them; being
grieued for offending him, and
very deſirous to pleaſe him. All
which and many the like be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proofes of their true loue
to God, whereby they may
proue that there is in them ſome
perſwaſion of Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, which cannot bee
without true faith; though faith
in it ſelfe, much leſſe the ioy
therein cannot bee ſeene. And
this I iudge to bee the cleereſt
proofe which a weake beleeuer
may haue, that he hath any faith;
which I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the more may bee
regarded, for that in my beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
I haue euer found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more auailable to comfort
a truely afflicted conſcience
(that is, one whoſe heart is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with ſorrow, for that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his miſerie, and deſiring
Chriſt his only remedie; yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29133:40"/>
cannot beleeue, at leaſt cannot
ſee he doth beleeue.)</p>
            <p>To returne then to theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Gods Spirit, whereby
it is manifeſt who hath the Spirit
of God dwelling in him; Euery
one muſt examine his own heart
what ſound ioy and comfort hee
hath of his ſaluation by Chriſt,
and what true loue he beareth to
God for the ſame; which two be
as the two maine Armes of the
tree of Life, from whence doe
iſſue and ſpring all other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of a godly life.</p>
            <p>From the former, that is, the
Ioy of Faith, doth grow all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in God, that we ſhall receiue
from him in due time and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
all needfull bleſsings. From
loue proceedeth a carefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to yeeld God all cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience, both in dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God and towards our
neighbour; in all which whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath no part, he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
know that as yet he hath not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29133:41"/>
receiued Gods Spirit; but on the
other ſide, if any man doe finde
theſe in him, and his heart doe
not beguile him, hee may haue
boldneſſe, that he is a true liuing
member of Chriſt. But for ſo
much as this is to too common,
that many bee deeply deceiued,
on both ſides: ſome, and theſe the
fewer and better ſort miſtruſting
themſelues, that theſe are not in
truth in them, and ſo fearing
they haue not truely receiued the
Spirit, and therefore are none of
Chriſts; when as in deed and in
truth they haue both, whoſe caſe
is good though they ſee it not,
and ſo remaine vncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Others the greater and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſort doe flatter themſelues,
they haue theſe and ſuch other
fruits of the Spirit, and ſo haue
true faith in Chriſt, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when indeed they haue none
of theſe in truth, but vaine ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of them.</p>
            <p>It is a matter exceeding need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29133:41"/>
to ſet downe ſome plaine
and infallible markes of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
whereby euery one may be
able to diſcerne of his eſtate,
whether he haue rightly receiued
the grace of God or no, that
hereby the ſound hearted
(though weake and full of
doubts) may be quieted, if not
comforted; and the proud hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and preſumptuous profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
may bee diſcouered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted;
wherein great care is
to be had, that the gate bee not
made too wide to let in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine
and looſe liuer, or too
ſtraight to ſhut out the pooreſt
and weakeſt beleeuer.</p>
            <p>1. One eſpeciall marke of a
ſound heart I haue obſerued
(chiefly in young Chriſtians and
weake beleeuers) is a godly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of being deceiued with
falſe faith,<note place="margin">Markes of ſoundneſſe.</note> ioy and loue, which
maketh them carefull to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
themſelues, and willing to
be tried by others; yea, they bee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29133:42"/>
earneſt with God to trie them,
to diſcouer to them the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or weakeneſſe of their
hearts, that both may bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
Whereas on the other ſide
the vnſound heart will not be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but as he flatters himſelfe all
is well, ſo he takes it very ill to be
ſuſpected by others.</p>
            <p>2. Another note that the grace
we haue receiued is true and not
counterſet, is this; that vpon
ſearch, finding that we haue ſome
ſorrow for our frailties, and ſome
deſires of being cleanſed by
Chriſt, and ſome faith and hope
therein, with ſome ioy and loue
of God for the ſame; yet we haue
withall, ſuch a ſight of our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in all of theſe, as makes vs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mourne for our wants, and to
thinke ſo meanely of our ſelues,
that we highly eſteeme the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God in others, and for our
owne parts deſire and labour for
nothing more, then to haue all
theſe increaſed in vs. Theſe and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29133:42"/>
the like bee the humble thoughts
and deſires of thoſe that haue
truely taſted of Gods grace.</p>
            <p>But they who thinke euery
little pricke to be deepe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or carnall and worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to be the true godly ſorrow,
and their vaine wiſhes to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
deſires, their fantaſies to
be faith, and ſo for all the reſt of
Gods gifts beſtowed vpon them;
doe dote vpon them, and their
happineſſe in them, and ſo liue
merrily, caſting away all mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for their manifold corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and be very buſie in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of others, and aduancing
themſelues: and now being full
doe take their eaſe, and grow
ſloathfull in holy exerciſes (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in priuat,) theſe I ſay and
ſuch like, are farre from true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
and might, if they
were not blinded, ſee their eſtate
more dangerous then ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw the light.</p>
            <p>3. A third marke of a true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29133:43"/>
ſuch as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was, in
whom was no guile, may be this,
that he is the ſame inwardly, and
in deed, which he is outwardly,
and in ſhew: as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the Iewe, and of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
ſo may we of a Chriſtian,
and of Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note> 
               <hi>That it muſt not
be outward onely, and in the fleſh,
but inward of the heart, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not in the letter; whoſe praiſe is
not of men, but of God.</hi> Whereby
appeareth that all ſuch who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a faire ſhew of faith and
loue, when in truth theſe bee not
in them, theſe be plaine Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
ſo farre from happineſſe as
they be from ſincerity.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, to end this point,
great euidence may bee had, that
our profeſsion is ſincere and not
fained,<note place="margin">Obedience in matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> 
               <hi>from our obedience to Gods
Commaundements, and that two
wayes, partly from the matter, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the manner.</hi> In eyther of
which wee ſhall ſee apparant dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29133:43"/>
betweene the childe of
God and him that is onely in
ſhew.</p>
            <p>For the former, the true child
of God from his heart hateth all
ſinne, which hee knoweth to bee
ſinne; yea thoſe ſinnes moſt,
which moſt annoye him, and ſuch
as his corrupt nature is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
vnto: and contrarily in
his heart deſireth to pleaſe God
in all things, and ſo in truth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
chiefly to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God in thoſe duties, to
which naturally hee is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing;
and ſo indeed doth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the fleſh, when it would moſt
reigne ouer him.</p>
            <p>The carnall Proteſtant on the
other ſide, will euer haue ſome
ſin ſo ſweete, that he hides it like
ſugar-candy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>der his tongue,
and cannot forgoe it, and he muſt
bee borne with in ſuch ſinnes as
are moſt pleaſing to his nature,
as the proud perſon in his pride,
the voluptuous in his pleaſures,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29133:44"/>
the couetous in his ſinfull gaine,
which ſhewes that their heart is
falſe, and doe leaue ſome ſinne
for by-reſpects; for did they in
truth hate ſinne, becauſe it is ſin,
and offendeth God, they would
hate one as well as another.</p>
            <p>So againe, hee that pretendeth
conſcience in ſome duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and wilfully neglecteth
others which hee knoweth God
requireth of him, and will by no
meanes be brought to doe them,
his heart is vnſound, reſpecting
more his owne eaſe, gaine, and
credit, then Gods honour or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
towards him. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hee that will not forgiue an
offence or debt, and will not ſhew
mercy, and releeue by giuing and
lending, when hee knoweth hee
ought. And ſo for the firſt table,
he that wilfully neglects holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of religion by himſelfe,

the care of thoſe who make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

In which it is manifeſt, they
looke onely to the outward
worke, and ſo waſh onely the

looke to the heart, and in what
manner they performe theſe
and all other holy duties.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we ſeene ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
markes, whereby euery man
who taketh vpon him the name
and profeſsion of a Chriſtian,
may try himſelfe, and know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his heart be vpright, and his
conuerſion ſound, without which
there can be no true comfort. But
hee that findeth theſe markes of
Chriſts ſheep vpon him (though
not ſo cleerely as ſome others
may) hee may haue boldnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and aſſure himſelfe
that he hath rightly receiued the
grace of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>So then to conclude this point,
how any man may certainely
knowe by the cauſes and effects
ſoundly wrought in him, that hee
hath true faith, and thereby is a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29133:46"/>
true member of Chriſt, and ſothe
child of God, and heire of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting.</p>
            <p>I deſire euery one wiſely to
laye all together, and to raiſe vp
their iudgement of their eſtate,
not vpon a peece or part therof,
but on the whole worke ioyned
together, which is onely auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to prooue any to be a houſe
or Temple for the Holy Ghoſt to
dwell in.</p>
            <p>This I adde for their ſakes who
dangerouſly hazard their hope
of happineſſe vpon ſome one of
theſe workes of Gods Spirit, or
more, which may be in thoſe that
periſh, who haue many of theſe.
(I ſay not in a ſanctified manner,
but in a common ſort, as hath
beene ſhewed already,) whereas
this among all, is one infallible
marke of Gods regenerating and
ſanctifying Spirit, that where he
beginneth, hee perfecteth his
worke; whom hee vniteth to
Chriſt by faith, he quickneth and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29133:46"/>
purgeth: ſo that faith without
fruits is a dead ſtocke, and all
fruites not growing out of faith,
are but as wild and bitter grapes
vnacceptable to God, and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to man.</p>
            <p>Hauing hitherto ſhewed what
true faith is,<note place="margin">How to liue by faith.</note> how it is wrought,
and how any man may knowe,
that this is truely wrought in
him by God Spirit:</p>
            <p>Now it followes to conſider
how hee that indeede harh this
pretious faith may liue thereby;
which is the principall matter by
me in this Treatiſe intended. For
the better vnderſtanding and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
whereof wee are wiſely to
weigh theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt thing,</hi> What it is to liue by
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How this is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>For the former, to liue by faith,
is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God hauing made
promiſe of all good things, more
then wee could aske or thinke,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29133:47"/>
that no good thing ſhall be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and whatſoeuer commeth,
ſhall be for our good. Wee are
ſo to beleeue, that we thereby be
aſwell ſatisfied when we haue no
meanes of helpe, as if we had all
that our hearts could deſire:
which is to be ſeen both in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſpirituall matters. As for
example, if a man ſhould fall into
any grieuous calamity, as into a
dangerous diſeaſe, and ſhould ſee
no way of helpe, yet if he beleeue
that God will ſurely helpe him,
this wil make him ſo to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and comforted, as if hee
had all preſent helpe that could
be deuiſed. So for ſpirituall, if
any ſhould fall into ſinne, ſo as he
had no hope of pardon, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
yet then to beleeue,
ſo as to reſt vpon Gods promiſe
for both, and ſo to be comforted,
this is to liue by faith. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of both is plaine in ſcripture
and in the liues of Gods faithfull
ſeruants. Notable is that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:29133:47"/>
whereof <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which
the Apoſtle citing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
<hi>that he aboue hope beleeued
in hope, that hee might become the
father of many nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according
to that which was ſpoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhal thy
ſeed be</hi> Wherin it is euident, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeing no poſſibility in

&amp; his wife not only barren from
her youth, but now paſt childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing,
ſhould haue a ſonne: yet
he, as it is ſaid, <hi>Not weak in faith,
conſidered not his owne body now
dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he was about an hundred
yeares old, neither yet the deadneſſe
of Sarahs wombe, ſtaggered not at

The ſelfe ſame is to bee ſeene in

               </gap>hoſe example wee might

as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. What a

in ſuch ſort that wee begin to

if there be any good word of the

that ſo calling it to minde, wee
might raiſe thereout ſuch hope
of helpe in due time, as may qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et

in effect that which before
we did expect. This doe I take
to be the ground of all our faith
whereby we liue, be maintained,

was before more fully laid out
when I ſhewed the way how any

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29133:49"/>
for the daily increaſe of

but the continuance of the ſame
meanes, namely, to call to minde
and to lay before vs, Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promiſes made to comfort
his people in all their neceſsities,
that thereby we might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted

of our vnruly thoughts and

to waite on God for his helpe,
which ſhall not bee wanting in

            <p>This being then the ground of
our faith, whereby we liue: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Gods promiſes, which are as

ſeeing they be many, ſome way

moſt principall of theſe, that we
may haue them in a readines for
our vſe in all occaſions to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſo good comfort, as if wee
had the beſt helpe preſent wee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
could deuiſe and deſire. What
will be the gaine of this practiſe,
I had rather we found by proofe,
then heare by report, and ſo I
hope we ſhall doe when wee ſhall
bee more particularly directed,
to put this inſtruction in practiſe.
But yet before hand for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
thus much will I ſay,
and no more then ſhall be found
true: That he who ſhall but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
in any truth to practiſe
this which here is taught, ſhall
finde his whole profeſsion (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t
euer his condition ſhall bee of
proſperity or aduerſitie) more
eaſie, and more comfortable. And
therefore to vtter my thoughts
more plainely, (if may be) I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
all that be weake of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not ſo exerciſed in the
ſcriptures (as ſome are) that they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29133:50"/>
can readily vpon euery occaſion
call to minde ſuch promiſes of
of God,<note place="margin">How to gather promiſes.</note> as bee then moſt fit for
their vſe; that ſuch, I ſay, if they
can write, would collect and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the holy Scriptures,
ſuch ſpecial promiſes as they ſhal
conceiue may moſt concerne
them, and be fitteſt to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their faith as need ſhall require.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as bee not able fitly
thus to releeue themſelues, my
next labour ſhall bee to gather
ſome ſpeciall promiſes, ſuch as I
conceiue bee of moſt vſe in our
ordinary affaires and courſe of
life, and referre them to their
places, that they may more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
be runne vnto, vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and likewiſe I will ſhew
how theſe may bee applyed to
our ſeuerall neceſſities for the
ſtrengthening of our faith, that
ſo we may liue thereby, and finde
ſufficient contentment in God,
when all other helpes faile. All
which wee ſhall hereafter more

ſee in their place.</p>
            <p>But now to proceede with

vſe the Prophets words, <hi>I will
heare what God the Lord wil ſpeak;
for hee will ſpeake peace vnto his

wee may build our faith, and

that we may attaine to this

               <hi>That we wiſely apply theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes

            <p>Secondly, <hi>to our preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
That it is ſuch as God hath

            <p>

For we ſhall ſee there bee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
promiſes, which all may
and ought to apply to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Now for the better practiſe of
this duty,<note place="margin">Meanes of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation &amp; prayer.</note> that we may ſo apply

we <hi>are to vſe meditation &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and that not ſlightly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

ſo to keepe our faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
that it alone may vpholde

this meditation I containe ſuch a
conſideration of Gods promiſes,
as may leade vs to ſee, what his
good will and pleaſure is, what a

hath, and not onely how able, but
how willing alſo he is to help vs.
And leſt wee ſhould bee diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

but that hee <hi>ſhewes mercy for his

to any one of his children,
not in any ſpeciall or proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

which properly belonged to

be true heire to all the promiſes
which God hath made to his

may boldly apply them all to
himſelfe, as if they were perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the former part of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29133:53"/>
of the promiſes to euery one
his owne perſon.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond, how to
apply them yet more neerely to
our preſent ſtate and condition
whatſouer,<note place="margin">2. How to apply the promiſes.</note> ſeeing the Lord hath
yeelded ſo much to our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as not onely in generall to
make out his promiſes to all his

to our ſeuerall eſtates and
necesſities, bodily and ſpirituall;
that in what condition ſoeuer
we be, and whatſoeuer worke of
his we ſhall vndertake, hee hath
made promiſes to his children,
<hi>To bee with them, to ſuccour and
ſupport them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 15 10 84. 11.</note>

               <hi>and whatſoeuer doth come, ſhal
be for their good.</hi> Seeing God, I
ſay, doth oft more ſpecially
intaile his promiſes: that is,
bequeath them to ſuch and ſuch

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:29133:53"/>
and the like many; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to our <hi>prayers, hearing</hi> of
his word, and <hi>all other holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
yea to <hi>all obedience</hi> to any of
his commandements:</p>
            <p>This ſhall bee our wiſedome,
and is our duty more ſpecially to
weigh how theſe belong vnto vs;
and finding our ſelues ſo qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in ſuch condition, as the
Lord made his promiſe vnto: we
may then much more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply his promiſe to vs in ſuch
eſtate, that ſo we may more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
beleeue and look for his
helpe al-ſufficient, and in due
ſeaſon. Which what quiet it will
bring to any in diſtreſſe, cannot
be hid or doubted of. And this
is that which I haue conceiued to
be the right way of application
of Gods promiſes by this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
&amp; wiſe conſidering of them,
that ſo wee may haue our vſe of
them.</p>
            <p>But yet all this is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

which he hath made vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Which ſeeing it is ſo weakly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 125. 1.</note> Yea more,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29133:55"/>
before I conclude this point
which I haue vndertaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
liuing by Faith, this will
I adde,<note place="margin">Gaine of liuing by faith.</note> what I conceiue will be
the exceeding gaine hereof;
which I haue once or twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
generally mentioned, but
reſerued more particularly to
this place to lay open, to this
end, that they who deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
theſe ſweet comforts, may be
willing to vſe the meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
for the attaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Wherein vpon ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I will forewarne of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which will hardly be auoided
without great care: That though
the labour to liue by Faith bee
neither tedious nor vnpleaſant,
much leſſe ſo grieuous as cannot
be endured: yet our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will not eaſily bee brought
to vndertake it, and more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be held with any conſtancie to
continue it;<note place="margin">Few labour for this or attaine to it.</note> Whereby it will
come to paſſe, that few, will finde
the fruit hereof promiſed; which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29133:56"/>
I obſerue comes to paſſe by a
ſpeciall policie of Sathan, who
(knowing that all our ſtrength
to reſiſt him lieth in Chriſt: and
all the helpe we haue from Chriſt
is principally by faith) doth
therefore in ſpeciall, labour by
all meanes to hinder our growth
in faith, that ſo he may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie
ouercome vs. Wherefore we
are exhorted 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 9. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the deuill ſtedfaſt in faith.</hi>
And our care muſt bee to <hi>ſtriue
for the maintenance of the faith
which was once giuen to the Saints;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iude ver. 3.</note>
As the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorteth.
And <hi>aboue all to take to vs the
ſhield of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16</note> 
               <hi>that we may quench
all the fiery darts of the Deuill;</hi>
That is, thoſe dreadfull terrors
of an afflicted conſcience ariſing
from ſenſe of Gods wrath han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
ouer vs, which as veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Darts lie burning in the
fleſh, ſo theſe doe torment mens
conſciences.</p>
            <p>The more to moue vs to bee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29133:56"/>
ſpecially careful herein, let vs wel
weigh what bee the vnualurable
commodities hereon enſuing,
that we may to our comfort en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the ſame. In thinking of
theſe, me thinkes I might make
a like anſwer to this queſtion,
What is the benefite of liuing by
faith, to that which the Apoſtle
made;<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 1, 2</note> 
               <hi>What is the profitte of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion:
Much euery way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to ſay the truth, there is
no good thing which God hath
prepared for the ſonnes of men,
or promiſed to any of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or they may euer looke for
and inioy: which can any other
way be obtained then by Faith.
As the Scripture plentifully
ſheweth, eſpecially in that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where it
is further ſaid, <hi>v. 2. That by faith
the Elders obtained a good report;</hi>
Which I vnderſtand thus: That
neuer was nor can bee done any
acte, which is worthy true
praiſe, but by Faith. For as it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29133:57"/>
muſt needs be ſinfull that is not
done of faith, and cannot pleaſe
God; ſo where true faith is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the meaſure of it) it
carries aboue all ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſuch admirable effects, as
doe euidently ſhew the power of
God to be preſent, and chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
therein. As may well bee
concluded out of that which the
Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19.</note>
               <hi>That they might know what is
the exceeding greatneſſe of Gods
power in vs that beleeue;</hi> which we
ſee, admirably extolleth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of Faith. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to reſt in generall, but
to laie open ſome part of theſe
great treaſures, which are enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Faith: I might content my
ſelfe to referre ſuch as deſire to
behold; and attaine the ſame, to
that excllent Treatiſe of the
Priuiledges which belong to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
true Chriſtian, ſet out by
Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> (which I could
wiſh were better regarded,)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29133:57"/>
wherein is fully laid out, what
ſpeciall fauours, and benefites
God hath prouided for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
both in this life, in all the
ſeuerall eſtates thereof: and in
the life to come; all which being
the free gift of God, and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
bequeathed to vs in Chriſt,
are receiued of vs only by Faith:
and are ſo many ſtrong motiues
to ſtirre vp all to ſtand faſt in the
faith, and by all good meanes to
maintaine the ſame. But ſeeing
that many haue not the booke,
and others want leiſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to reade ſuch large Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
I will draw out ſome of the
principall, which ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to perſwade vs, to ſpare no
paines, whereby we may be made
partakers of ſo great benefites.
Wherein let this be firſt: That
whereas they bee exceeding few
who attaine to that bleſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
ſet downe, <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3,
4,</hi> 5. yet they that bee iuſtified
by Faith doe inioy them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:29133:58"/>
As firſt,<note place="margin">1. Benefite of faith is peace.</note> 
               <hi>To haue peace towards
God:</hi> That is, whereas euery
ſoule <hi>by nature is the childe of
wrath,</hi> and ſo at mortall warre
with God, being a ſeruant of ſin
and Sathan, Gods ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
and therefore vtterly out
of Gods fauour, and ſubiect to
his fearefull indignation: Now
for ſuch an one to bee releaſed
from his treſpaſſe and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and <hi>to bee ſo reconciled to
God through our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> that there is an euerlaſting
peace concluded betweene God
and him, that there ſhall neuer be
any more variance, or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
this cannot bee thought a
ſmall benefit. And if it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a rebell and his Prince, it
would be redeemed with a great
price. This is much, yet behold
more; for as it is a farre higher
fauour, for a Traitor not onely
to be pardoned, and freed from
the Kings diſpleaſure, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled: but to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29133:58"/>
to ſpeciall grace,<note place="margin">2. To bee admitted into high fauour to be ſonnes.</note> and made one,
whom the King ſingularly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
and maketh of his priuie
Councell, and taketh great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in, ſo that he may haue free
acceſſe into the Kings preſence,
and to whom the King can denie
nothing: In a word, to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
as <hi>Joſeph in</hi> Pharaoes
<hi>court, or</hi> Mordecay <hi>in</hi> Ahaſhue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
<hi>Court,</hi> ſo to bee taken into
like fauour with God: Yea
more, of an enemy to be made a
ſonne, and heire, yea coheire with
Chriſt; this is ſo high a fauour,
as more cannot bee conceiued.
Yet this is that, which is here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the former; That we who
bee iuſtified by Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> by <hi>Chriſt
haue acceſſe through faith vnto this
grace wherein wee ſtand.</hi> Which
I thus vnderſtand (as I ſaid)
that wee be not onely fully and
freely diſcharged, from all Gods
diſpleaſure iuſtly conceiued for
our ſinne, and ſo a full peace
made betweene God and vs: But
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29133:59"/>
hereby alſo <hi>wee bee aduanced to
that high dignity to be the ſonnes of
God,</hi> as it is called <hi>Iohn 1. 12.
Which is that grace wherein wee
now ſtand.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 5. 2.</note> By meanes whereof
we may boldly crie <hi>Abba Father,</hi>
and haue free acceſſe to come
into his preſence <hi>to aske what wee
will, with aſſurance it ſhall bee done
vnto vs,</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 23, 24.</note>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 7. And from
hence doe flowe all other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
as fruits and effects of this
grace and fauour, into which we
be admitted.</p>
            <p>Among which, one principall
followes in this Scripture, <hi>That
we reioyce in the hope of the glory
of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> That is, how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſoeuer our ſtate bee in this
world, (which vſually is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
yet we haue hope of ſuch
a glorious eſtate to come,<note place="margin">3 Ioy of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> with
God in his kingdome, as doth
make vs not onely inwardly to
reioyce; but openly to expreſſe
it in word and deed. In word,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29133:59"/>
when in a heauenly manner wee
doe boaſt as it were of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
which wee ſhall haue with
God, when we ſhall bee receiued
into his kingdome: as we reade
<hi>Paul</hi> did oft,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18, 38.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. In
deed, when we openly ſhew,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10.</note> that
on the one ſide wee are content
to forgoe theſe tranſitorie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note>
which the worldlings
ſo magnifie, that they fell heauen

whereof was <hi>Moſes, Heb. 11. 24.
That hee when hee was come to

               <note place="margin">25.</note>

               <hi>chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſuffer affliction with the
people of God, then to enioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſinne for a ſeaſon: estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the reproach of Chriſt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
riches then the treaſures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt;
For he had reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward.</hi> And on the
other ſide when wee are willing
to doe as our Lord and Maſter
Chriſt did, <hi>Who for the ioy that
was ſet before him, endured the

is ſet downe at the right hand of
the throne of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> So when wee
ſhall bee willing to ſuffer with
Chriſt, that we may reigne with
him, and ſhall <hi>count that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of this preſent time are not
worthy to bee compared with the
glory that ſhall be reuealed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18,</note> then
doe we truely glory in the hope
of the glory of God; and (to ſay
the truth) as none can doe theſe,
but ſuch as haue hope of this
glory, ſo he that hath this hope,
cannot but count all doung for
Chriſt, and to bee glorified with
him: for howſoeuer it bee moſt
true of this glory, that it is ſuch
as eye hath not ſeene, eare hath
not heard, neither can it enter
into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of the excellencie of this
glorie, yet God hath giuen to his
beloued, ſuch a glimpſe of it, as
<hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 17. 1</note>

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 21.</note> 
               <hi>as Chriſt and his

which our Sauiour himſelfe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto his Father. All which ſo
farre exceeding the ſhort reach
of our weake capacitie, wee may
ſee cauſe ſufficient, why they who
are aſſured by faith, they ſhall
certainely and fully enioy this
glory, when they <hi>lay downe this

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. expreſly affirmeth,
why they, I ſay, doe thus reioyce
and glory in this glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:29133:61"/>
How great a benefite this is,
though it cannot be valued, yet
euery one who hath his ſences
exerciſed, to diſcerne both good
and euill, may eaſily ſee, that it is
ſuch and ſo great, as nothing to
bee deſired may bee compared
with it. And therefore there is
cauſe enough to drawe all that
knowe it, to ſpare no coſt or

it.</p>
            <p>In the next words,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3</note> the Apoſtle
yet not ſatisfied in ſetting out
the ſingular benefites which are
enioyed by this life of faith, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this, as a great enlargement
of the former, That the beleeuer
doth <hi>not onely ſo,</hi> that is, in a holy
manner, <hi>Glory in the hope of Gods
glory; but we glory alſo in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
knowing that tribulation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
patience, v. 4. and patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and experience hope, v. 5.
&amp; hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe
the loue of God is ſhed abroad in our

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29133:61"/>
giuen to vs,</hi> wherein he intendeth
that ſuch is the power of faith
where it is liuing, that it ſo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eteth
and comforteth Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in their meaneſt condition,
that they not onely reioyce in
the hope of that glorie to come,
(which is the beſt part of their

more admirable) that they finde
matter of outward reioycing in
the worſt part,<note place="margin">Reioycing in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that is, in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and afflictions of what

<hi>Iames 1. 2. My brethren count
it all ioy, when you fall into diuers

of your faith worketh patience, &amp;c.</hi>
Whereof we haue the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 10. a worthie
example, who ſaith of himſelfe,
<hi>Therfore I take pleaſure in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note>
               <hi>in reproches, in neceſſities, in

conſidered, how vnwelcome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29133:62"/>
theſe be to the naturall man, and
nippe the heart of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and reioycings; it will bee
counted a ſingular benefite <hi>in all
of theſe to be more then conquerers,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.
That is, not only to ouercome
theſe with faith and patience, but
to glorie in them and reioyce,
that <hi>wee are counted worthy to
ſuffer ſhame for his name.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> And
whereas the naturall man doth
for theſe eſpecially ſhunne true
religion, and the ſincere profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
therof, which vſually brings
the croſſe and manifold troubles;
What a ſingular comfort is this,
that Gods childe may aſſure
himſelfe, theſe afflictions (how
many and great ſoeuer) yet they
ſhall bee ſo farre ftom hurting
him, that they ſhall all turne to
his good many waies? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he hath iuſt matter of
ioy and thankes, though not for
the paine and griefe which bee
bitter, but for the gaine which is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29133:62"/>
ſweet, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
            <p>Becauſe this is not readilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
the Apoſtle in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Rom. 5. 3, &amp;c.</hi> doth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
to giue ſufficient reaſon
hereof; namelie this, that the

patience experience,<note place="margin">Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hope, &amp;c. In all which hee
ſetteth forth certaine ſpeciall
fruites, which Gods children
reape by afflictions: Namelie
theſe; That whereas we all are by
nature like vntamed Heiffers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
accuſtomed to the yoke, who
by bearing the yoke bee made
gentle and willing to put their
neckes vnder the yoke, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to beare it; ſo Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
being not acquainted with
afflictions, be much diſquieted
therwith at firſt: But afterwards
being more exerciſed with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
tribulations, grow more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
and become more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beare them, and quietly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29133:63"/>
to endure them, which alone is
true patience: Not to be furious
or ſenceleſſe, but meekely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
vnder Gods hand, and ſo <hi>To
hold their peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 9.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe God who
cannot erre hath done it.</hi> The worth
of this may herein bee ſeene, in
that ſo few haue well learned this
Chriſtian patience.</p>
            <p>From hence ariſeth another
ſpeciall fruit,<note place="margin">Patience brings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> namely experience.
That as Mariners at the firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſea, ſeeing the great
waues, and toſsing of the ſhip,
looke ſtill to bee ſwallowed vp
and to periſh; but afterward by
enduring many of theſe ſtormes,
grow to ſuch experience of
Gods power in preſeruing them,
that they doe not ſo feare periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as before, but cheerefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them: Euen ſo the faithfull,
how ſo euer at the firſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be diſmayed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
troubles they meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
corruptions within, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
without, (reproches and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29133:63"/>
iniuries by men of the world not
the leaſt,) yet afterwards by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
enduring of theſe, they
finde by proofe, that God hath
made them able to beare them,
and graciouſly deliuered them.
Whereby they grow to bee as
trained ſouldiers, better exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both to beare and profite by
them; and ſo to waite for a good
end and iſſue out of them,
which is the next benefite here
mentioned: namely hope, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Experience bringeth hope.</note> 
               <hi>Experience worketh
hope;</hi> whereby is meant, that as
in all kinde of difficulties, men
hauing often found helpe and
releaſe, doe gather thereout
hope of like aſsiſtance for time
to come; Euen ſo likewiſe the
often proofe and experience
which the faithfull haue of Gods
mightie power, and readie helpe
in all their trials and troubles,
both preſeruing them vnder
their heauie burthens, and in due
time and meaſure eaſing them,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29133:64"/>
and in the end fully releaſing
them: The experience hereof (I
ſay) makes them hope and looke
for like helpe hereafter in time
of need. What ſweet eaſe and
refreſhing this brings to a weary
heart, may be ſeene by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and true prouerbe: <hi>If it
were not for hope hart would break.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to goe no further, the
next words makes it manifeſt:
Where it is ſaid, <hi>Hope maketh not
aſhamed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 5. Hope makes not aſhamed.</note> That is, when wee bee
ſore diſtreſſed, and ſee no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

naturally wee begin to
faint; and to bee confounded in
our ſelues, and ſo driuen to hide
our heads for ſhame, as not able
to abide the reprochfull ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which vſually paſſe vpon
men ſo caſt downe. A cleere
proofe whereof we haue in <hi>Iobs</hi>
caſe. Then if there bee any true

promiſe of helpe in due time,
which is imbraced by faith; then,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29133:64"/>

of hope is fitly compared to an

dares boldly hold vp his head

            <p>This is the benefite which the
beleeuer hath in all extremities,
which no other can enioy. For
they if they be not ſenſeleſſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtruggle like a wilde beaſt

            <p>If this be ſo, let it bee then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to bee no common
bleſsing to liue by faith; which
beſides many others, brings ſuch
patience, experience, hope, and

The true cauſe of all which the
Apoſtle here laieth downe to bee
this,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe the loue of God is ſhed
abroad in their hearts by the Holy
Ghoſt which is giuen to vs;</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that as the loue of a friend,
is beſt tried and ſeene in greateſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29133:65"/>
need: ſo Gods loue vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
is moſt manifeſt in their
greateſt tribulations.</p>
            <p>For wheras at other times God
giues to his, ſome ſweet taſtes of
his fatherly loue,<note place="margin">Eſa. 63. 9.</note> 
               <hi>In all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
he is ſo troubled,</hi> &amp; his bowels
ſo moued, that like a tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee as it were dandles them
in his lap, and ſpeaks ſo kindly to
them; yea not onely bemones
them, but helpes them euery way
as need requires; that now they
ſee plainly, how tenderly he loues
them; which grace is wrought in
them by the holy Ghoſt, which is
giuen to all beleeuers; All which
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth Gods high fauour to
theſe, and ſo the moſt happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of them all, and of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that liue by faith. All which
is contained in this one ſcripture,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. which I haue but ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and not powred out all that
herein is contained. Now if this
one boxe of Spikenard containe
ſuch ſtore of ſweet conſolations,
what may wee thinke is to bee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29133:65"/>
drawn out of al other ſcriptures?
I dare ſay a large volume; for to
ſay what I haue obſerued, (&amp; all
may ſee who will conſider it) that
although the Lord in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; loue regarding our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who are not more loth to read
much, then prone to forget what
we reade, hath ſet downe his will
in vnimitable breuity; yet he is
very plentifull in laying forth <hi>his
exceeding great &amp; precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note>
as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calleth them: All
which doe containe thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
earthly and ſpirituall, for
this life and that to come, which
God hath prepared for all true
beleeuers; who onely being the
iuſt poſſeſſors of theſe, I thinke
it ſufficiently proueth that
which I intend, What benefite
it is to liue by faith. Which may
more manifeſtly be ſeene by the
Apoſtles own words in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note>
where he of purpoſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to ſet out what is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
eſtate of thoſe that be iuſtified
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29133:66"/>
by faith, and ſo brings in all theſe
ſingular benefites we haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Yea, and addeth that it
is by faith, <hi>that wee haue acceſſe
into this grace wherein wee ſtand.</hi>
And to ſay the truth, (as hath
beene ſaid alreadie,) neither
theſe, nor any other ſauing grace,
or true bleſsing is obtained, but
by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore I may
conclude, that hee that lookes to
finde any comfort in this life, and
to nouriſh the hope of a better,
let him make it his chiefe indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
thus to liue by faith, by
which alone, theſe and ail that
may be deſired, are enioyed.</p>
            <p>And thus would I leaue this
point to be proued rather by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
then by argument, and
ſo come to that I chieflie aime
at, to bring this doctrine into
practiſe; and as I promiſed to
collect ſome ſpeciall promiſes,
and to ſhew how they are to bee
applied particularly to euery
perſon, and condition to whom
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29133:66"/>
they belong. But that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
there is one other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vſe of Faith, whereof
though we ſtand in great need,
yet it is very weakely attained,
becauſe it is ſo little ſought after,<note place="margin">Another benefite of liuing by faith, is our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
And this it is, how by faith wee
might more maſter our greateſt
corruptions, and better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
thoſe duties wherein wee
moſt faile. Wherein the more
to moue all that reade this, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to regard it, I doe with hearts
griefe bewaile, to ſee ſo many,
of whom I conceiue good hope,
that they haue truly receiued the
grace of God, that yet neither
themſelues can feele, nor others
diſcerne any apparant growth in
true ſanctification, either in
the ſubduing of their chiefeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
or ſuch a walking in
their places as beſeemeth their
condition. But in generall ſuch
a conformitie to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the times, ſuch deadneſſe
of ſpirit in all holy exerciſes,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29133:67"/>
with a groſſe and continuall
neglect, or common abuſe of
them; as priuate reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and prayer,<note place="margin">Many ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes in regenerate perſons.</note> inſtruction
and wiſe gouernment of their
Families, holy conference in

ſuch care of edifying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And on the other ſide,
ſuch vaine and ſinfull merrie-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that there is but ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene them and
meere naturall men. As for their
worldly dealings, as eagerly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the world, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereabouts; as buſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their pleaſure, with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie
in houſes, apparell, deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their children and the like,
and generally ſuch ſetting their
mindes and affections vpon theſe
things here below, as men that
are not riſen with Chriſt. I might
ſay no leſſe of their vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
many waies, and great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie
in euery thing that
croſſeth them; with ſundrie the
like great and long continued

blemiſhes of their holy profesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and iuſt abaters of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

haue ſeen &amp; heard the deathes of
many to haue had little to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced
in: and no maruell, ſeeing
they tooke ſo little care either to
glorifie God in their life, or to
win others, or to make their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
&amp; election ſure. It was moſt
iuſt with God, that their death
ſhould want of that glory with
others, &amp; comfort to themſelues,
which others of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do
enioy; who liuing by faith, haue
learned better to bridle their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
affections, &amp; more wiſely to
walke to the honor of God, edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of others, &amp; peace to their

               </gap>aith, &amp; notwithout

now ſhall further be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
The Apoſtle, <hi>Romanes</hi> 7. 14,
ſaith, ſpeaking of himſelfe,
beeing now regenerate, ſaith
<hi>That the Lawe is ſpirituall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I

effectually regenerated, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
ſuch a corrupt nature, as
keepeth them from many good

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
euill actions: yea, and that
with ſuch ſtrong hand oftentimes
that they haue no power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
as followes, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
himſelfe to a poore ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
taken priſoner by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and helde in captiuity till he
be reſcued by his captaine; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that Gods children are oft
ſo held captiues to their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they haue no power
to reſiſt, much leſſe to ouercome,
till by the power of Chriſt they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29133:68"/>
be deliuered out of this thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as may bee ſeene in all the
particulars before mentioned. As
for example, when a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhall be ſo poſſeſſed with the
loue of this worldly wealth, that
though he deſire and purpoſe to
be more mercifull to Gods nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Saints, yet when he comes to
it, he cannot ouercome himſelfe
to relieue according to his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and their neceſsitie; but euen
againſt the light of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
either giues not, or not ſo
much as he ſhould. So much more
for lending, for conſcionable
buying and ſelling: and as in all
matters of profite, ſo of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
hee that is in captiuity to
them, no purpoſes, prayers, no
vowes can keepe him backe, but
he will obey his luſt, in vaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
in going to playes, in
cardes, dice, and other gamings.
The impotency of many in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their luſts, ſhewes in
what captiuity they be held: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29133:69"/>
in reuenge, and vncharitable
thoughts, of ſuch as haue done
them wrong. They which be able
to diſcerne their owne corrupt
nature, may eaſily ſee with what
difficultie they doe bridle their
luſts; nay oft, how imposſible it
is, to giue to ſuch as offend them,
a good word, or a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>By all which and many the like,
it euidently appeares, that many
of Gods children be thus held in
captiuity, that they cannot by all
the ſtrength they haue get out:
ſo that without they bee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Chriſt, they ſhal bequite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome:
which the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in this very place expreſſeth,
where complaining hereof with
griefe and admiration at the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of the worke (not in any

               <hi>O wretched

from the body of this death?</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he makes anſwere himſelfe,
ſaying, <hi>I thanke God through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29133:69"/>
Chriſt our Lord:</hi> meaning,
that though hee ſawe, neither in
himſelfe, nor in any creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
any power to deliuer him
from the corruption of nature,
which brings death, where it is
not ſubdued: yet hee ſawe ſuch
helpe in Chriſt, as made him
ioye to giue thankes to God for
the ſame. Wherein I obſerue a
worthy practiſe of this which I
chiefly endeauour to drawe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
vnto, namely, How by
faith to maſter their ſtrongeſt
corruptions: For here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
finding no where out of
Chriſt, any ſufficient power to
deliuer him out of this captiuitie
to ſinne and death, by the hand
of faith hee layeth holde vpon
Chriſt, aſſuring himſelfe vpon
Chriſts promiſe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12 9</note> 
               <hi>That his grace
ſhould be ſufficient for him, and that
his power ſhould be magnified in his

not bee left in his enemies
hands, but in due time to be ſet at
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29133:70"/>
libertie more freely to ſerue the
Lord. This is that I commend to
the practiſe of euery true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
that whenſoeuer hee feeles
his corruptions too hard for him,
that he cannot by all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors
get the maſterie ouer them,
then to flye to Chriſt, and by
true faith to applye his promiſes
for the mortifying of ſinne, that
thereby hee may receiue power
from Chriſt more to crucifie the
olde man with his members.</p>
            <p>For our better performance
whereof, I will a little digreſſe,
(though not farre from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
briefly to ſet out, the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and the ſureſt way which I

ſtandeth in the diligent exerciſe
of theſe 4 rules following.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">4. rules of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that whereas wee bee all

cauſe; euery one who will morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

            <p>Theſe meanes be:</p>
            <p>1. A true examination of our

            <p>2. Secondly, a carefull obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of all our wayes; and as

get our hearts to be weary of the
ſame, and willing to be cured of
it; which ſhall be if we conſider
the great hurt it brings vs, partly
in keeping good things from vs,
and partly in pulling downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs ſo many euills vpon ſoule
and body, our ſelues and others
belonging to vs. To ſet out theſe
in particulars would not be hard,
but it would carry mee too farre
from my matter intended. It
ſhall ſuffice to remember in this
caſe, that all our woe comes from
our ſinnes, as both Scripture,
reaſon, and continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doe ſhewe: which if it were
well weighed, would make vs
more weary of our ſinne, then of
our ſickneſſe or other affliction,
and breede in vs much more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
deſires to bee cured. And
therefore this muſt bee another
daily conſideration, both what
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29133:71"/>
bitter fruites our ſinnes bring
foorth, and that from thence all
the woes we meete withall doth
ſpring.</p>
            <p>The third and moſt principall
rule is,<note place="margin">3. rule is to get power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt.</note> That for ſo much as ſuch
is our frailtie, that when we haue
got ſome true ſight of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
corruptions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
ſome loathing of them,
with an earneſt deſire to be ridde
of them; yet wee haue no ability
in our ſelues to mortifie them,
but <hi>All our ſufficiency is of God,</hi>
and <hi>without</hi> Chriſt, <hi>wee can doe
nothing,</hi> as is oft ſaid, but neuer
ſufficientlie regarded: Therefore
hereupon eſpecially dependeth
all our power to mortifie ſinne,
that we by faith doe drawe from
Chriſt that power and vertue,
which is in him, to change our
crabbed and ſowre nature, that
wee may bee ſweete and pleaſant
grapes for the Lord our God.
This is that eſpecially which I
ayme at, to perſwade all that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29133:72"/>
faine would get more maſtery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their ſtrong corruptions and
vnrulie affections: namely, to do
as the woman in the Goſpel, <hi>Who
hauing an iſſue of blood twelue yeers,
and had ſuffered many things of the
Phyſitions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 25.</note> 
               <hi>and had ſpent all that
ſhe had, and was nothing better, but
rather grew worſe; when ſhe heard
of Ieſus, came in the preaſſe behind
him, and touched his garment; for
ſhe ſaid, if I may but touch him, I
ſhall be whole: and ſtraight way the
fountaine of her blood was dryed vp,
and ſhe felt in her body that ſhe was
healed of that plague.</hi> Euen ſo muſt
we all, who haue had many foule
iſſues of ſinne, of pride, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
ſecurity, preſumption, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
vncleaneneſſe, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the like many, and haue
taken great paines, and beene
nothing the better, but rather
growne worſer: (for ſo muſt it
needes be till we come to Chriſt)
doe wee what poſsiblie wee can;
ſuch I ſay muſt come to Chriſt,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29133:72"/>
and touch him by a true faith,
and then ſhall they feele vertue
to come from him, to drye vp
this fountaine of their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Oh that this might be brought
more into tryall, what would be
the difference betweene this and
all other practiſes for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the fleſh, which without
this ſhall bee found inſufficient,
if not deceiueable: for where ſhal
be found any vertue to kill ſinne
in our nature, but in Chriſt in our
nature? Can mans reaſon, will,
or reſolution ſuffiſe to draw him
to forſake his ſo pleaſing, and
profitable ſinnes, as hee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?
If this might bee in ſome
outward actions, in reſpect of
men, yet this cannot bee in the
heart to pleaſe God, which is
onely the worke of Gods Spirit
in true beleeuers. How this is to
be done, hath beene before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;
here onely I commend
the vſe of this liuing by faith,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29133:73"/>
without which, as there is no
true mortification of any ſinne
whatſoeuer: ſo by this, wee ſhall
ſurely obtaine power againſt the
oldeſt and ſtrongeſt corruptions
in our nature.</p>
            <p>Whereunto if one thing be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I well ſee not what ſhould
be wanting, to the mortification
of them all; at leaſt in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as God will accept of, and
wee may haue comfort in; which
is the fourth rule by mee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:<note place="margin">4. rule of mortifying ſinne.</note>
namely, That hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
1. a true ſight of ſinne. 2. a

ſubduing of it: then in the laſt

               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> The ſame
may be ſaide for the other part

this for helpe of the weaker, to
ſhewe them how by the helpe of

may be able in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

though they may haue ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

this ignorance will ſo blind them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ſhal not find the way; which
is one chiefe cauſe, why the liues

            <p>The great neede and vſe of
this knowledge, what God
would haue vs to doe in our
places, and in our ſeuerall eſtates

may eaſily bee ſeene by all that

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29133:76"/>
to carry themſelues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I aduiſe all who may looke
for any comfort of an holy life,
carefully to examine themſelues
in what duties they be moſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
either in not doing them,
or doing them amiſſe. And for
their helpe to doe as before was
taught in the firſt rule of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow to find out our chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

it ought to be done, that this
may be euer as a light to ſhew vs
the good way wherein God

            <p>This is the firſt rule to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
for the well ordering of
our whole life; which though it
be ſo neceſſary, that there can be
no good life without it, yet it is
not ſufacient.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the next
place,<note place="margin">2. rule to get a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind.</note> wee are to labour to get

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29133:76"/>
know God requires; for wee are
not more ignorant what God
would haue vs to do, and in what
manner, then vnwilling to doe
either, as our daily practiſe proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
eſpecially to do more then
vſually is done, which the Lord
knowth is very poorely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
for to let paſſe the carnall
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; hypocrite, who do al
to halfes, and for ſhew, this will
be found in thoſe that haue ſome
truth, that though they make
conſcience of ſome duties, yet
are very hardly brought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which bee more laborious,
or more crosſing their corrupt
nature in their credit, profite or
pleaſure. Hence it is that many
are ſo negligent and ſlight in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
priuate prayer, meditating,
inſtructing of their families, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
of the Sabboth: ſo
hardly brought to ſobrietie and
and true liberalitie. But of all,
how ſeldome can the moſt of vs
be brought to humble our ſelues

in faſting and prayer, though
wee haue neuer ſo many and iuſt
cauſes to pull vs often hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
both for our ſelues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in publike and priuate.
Theſe and the like prooue this
rule to bee moſt needefull,
to gette our hearts more
willing to euery known dutie.</p>
            <p>The way whereby this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
is an often and aduiſed
conſideration of the great gaine
which comes by a conſcionable
diſcharge of theſe duties that
belong vnto vs, in bringing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

peace to their owne ſoules; all
which is more commonlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,

            <p>Of this gaine well ſpake the

theſe were as they ſhould bee,
well remembred and regarded, it
would at leaſt make vs willing to
doe our vtmoſt, to pleaſe God;
which yet is not enough to make
vs able to doe what we would,
for that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> we finde much more in

            <p>There is neede therefore of a

in Chriſt, and muſt be from him

muſt bee (as before, for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
ſo now for new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
to flie to Chriſt, and to lay
holde on him by a true faith, that
through him wee ſhall bee able
to doe all things, and from him
receiue all grace neceſſarie for
the leading of a godly life; which
is a ſpeciall part of this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
wee haue by faith, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our ſelues ſo weake vnto
euery good worke, by faith in

In which reſpect alſo, I commend
it to our dailie practiſe, that thus
liuing by faith, our liues may
bring more glorie to God, good
example and profite to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29133:81"/>
with ſweet comfort to our

            <p>For the better practiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">4. Rule to ſet vpon duties.</note>
the fourth rule is alſo to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
namely With this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
deſire, and faith, to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the duties we moſt faile in, &amp;
to put to all our ſtrength to doe
the will of God in all things, and
that in ſuch manner as may bee
moſt acceptable through Chriſt.
To this end be all thoſe exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto holy life in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
both in the writings of the
Apoſtles and Prophets;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note> as <hi>to loue
our enemies, to bleſſe thoſe that curſe
vs,</hi> and the like many. All which,
though iuſtly by God required of
all men, yet indeed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without faith, which is the
cauſe why they be ſo ſeldome, and
that very ſleightly obeyed: For
as ſome will ſet vpon holy duties
by their owne ſtrength, and not
drawing by faith vertue from
Chriſt, do labor in vain; ſo on the
other ſide, many idle profeſſors
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29133:82"/>
dangerouſly deceiue themſelues,
in ſaying they hope in Chriſt for
power and ſtrength to lead a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, and yet very idly neglect
thoſe labours which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
whereby they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to more grace and better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
ſo that all thoſe rules
will bee found ſo neceſſarie, that
not one of them can bee ſpared,
but he that looketh for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of a good conſcience, either
in the ouercomming of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ſinnes, or conſcionable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of his ſpeciall duties, muſt
conſtantly obſerue theſe rules, by
which I dare affirme (to ſay no
more) his gaine ſhall anſwer all
his paines.</p>
            <p>And thus haue I as briefely as
I can, and plainly (vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
occaſion) ſhewed, how a
true beleeuer may attaine vnto
this great grace to leade a godly
life in both the parts of it, in
dying to all ſinne, and liuing to
all righteouſneſſe; Which as no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29133:82"/>
other can poſsibly attaine vnto,
ſo neither they all who beleeue
to be ſaued by Chriſt, doe enioy
this benefite: for though they be
renewed in part, and in ſome
meaſure doe mortifie the fleſh,
and make conſcience of ſome
duties, both of holineſſe, and
righteouſneſſe, without which
they could not proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to haue any ſauing faith;
yet either not knowing how to
liue by faith, ſo as thereby they
might ſhine as lights in the
darke world; or not practiſing
this knowledge, they be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dimme lights, but giue out bad
example, liuing many waies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiuely,
to the reproch of their
profeſsion, griefe of the godly,
and ſmall peace or comfort to
their owne conſciences. All
which might bee well auoided
and the contrary bleſsings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed,
if this liuing by faith were
brought into daily vſe; By all
which, and the former benefites
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29133:83"/>
of liuing by faith laid together,
I hope may be ſufficiently ſeene,
that there is no life comparable
to this life of Faith; yea rather
none to bee deſired beſides this,
which only hath all the promiſes
of this life preſent, and that
which is to come. And therefore
to conclude this former part of
the Treatiſe,<note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of firſt part.</note> wherein I haue as
plainly as I can, ſet out firſt what
true faith is, how it is gotten,
how any may know that they
haue true Faith. And ſecondly
what it is to liue by Faith, how
this is attained by a wiſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Gods promiſes; and
herewith the manifold and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
benefites ariſing from
hence: I doe in the Lord, with all

any true faith in Chriſt, and
deſire to adorne it with an holy
life, and yet vpon beter exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

their profeſsion to haue beene of

as ſmall comfort to themſelues,
(to ſpeake nothing of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue

learne to liue by Faith, &amp; to this
end to follow this direction here
ſet downe, till they ſhall bee able
better to guide themſelues. And
ſo my hope and prayer ſhall be,
that God will let them ſee ſuch
fruit of their labour, as ſhall bring
them more true comfort daily,
then in many daies, and to ſome
more then in any daie of their
life paſt; which I humbly beſeech
the Lord to grant both to
my ſelfe, and them, euen
for his Chriſts

the Goſpell, taking away a chiefe

of workes (wherein God
promiſed life vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of doing all that was written

many, is no condition required

whom he pleaſeth. How theſe
are by vs to bee applied after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I will ſhew. But now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very many, yea the moſt

ſome condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either expreſſed
or neceſſarily vnderſtod, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
wiſely to conſider of them; as

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in others the dutie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29133:86"/>

                  </gap>be of God which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away the ſinnes of the world.</hi>
And the like many. In all which
Faith is neceſſarily vnderſtood,
for the obtaining of the benefite
promiſed. But yet in all theſe,
Faith is no condition, properly
ſo called, mouing God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
life, although in ſome ſort it
may bee called a condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the promiſe of life is made
to perſons qualified with Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for firſt, faith it ſelfe is part of the
thing promiſed, and no man can
beleeue except it bee giuen him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore an impoſsible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to bee performed of our
ſelues. And to ſay as it is, Faith
do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h apply the fruite and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the promiſe to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
(who alone ſhall enioy the
thing promiſed,) and doth not
reſtraine the offer of grace,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29133:87"/>
which is generall to all to whom
the Goſpell comes; who as they
haue no faith before they heare
the promiſe made to them, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hearing this promiſe made to
them, if they beleeue not, they
ſhall bee condemned for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
as <hi>John 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Thus then
I conceiue all conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the Goſpell are to bee
taken, that God doth freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
mercie in what kinde ſoeuer,
and for the enioying thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſome dutie of obedience
at our hands. Now we muſt firſt
beleeue and ſo obey, and then
enioy the thing promiſed, ſo that
there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>beleeuing,</hi>
but all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> promiſe;
and our obedience only is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of our faith, and ſo a proofe
of Faith, no cauſe to moue vs to
beleeue. As for example, <hi>If you
forgiue you ſhall be forgiuen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 14.</note> God
freely offers pardon to vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that wee beleeuing ſhew
mercy to others, As we reade in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29133:87"/>
the parable, <hi>Math, 18. 32. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue
thee all the debt, becauſe thou
deſiredſt me, ſhouldeſt not thou alſo
haue compaſſion on thy fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
euen as I had pittie on thee?</hi>
So then he that beleeues to finde
mercy, is thereby moued to ſhew
mercy, and certainely hee that
ſhewes no mercie in deed recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
none.</p>
            <p>Beſides this,<note place="margin">An other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> there is an other
conſideration of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which ſtandes in the diuers
qualitie of the things promiſed,
whereof ſome be wholly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
for our ſaluation, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without any reſtraint,<note place="margin">Simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> and
are ſo to be beleeued, as Faith
and Repentance. Other things
though good in themſelues; yet
are not alwaies good for vs, but
we may be ſaued without them,
and in ſome caſe, better want
them then haue them: as health,
wealth, peace, and all earthlie
bleſsings: yea, many common
gifts of the Spirit, at leaſt the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29133:88"/>
meaſure of them; as excellent
wit, memorie, knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
things, courage, liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
gentleneſſe, &amp;c. all of theſe
be promiſed with limitation,<note place="margin">With limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> ſo
farre as they be good for vs, and
no further; and ſo farre onely
are to bee deſired and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>Another needfull conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods promiſes, that wee
may better make our vſe of
them, is this, that God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
in the Goſpell his Sonne
Chriſt and all his benefites ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to all,<note place="margin">Generall promiſes offered to all.</note> and euery ſoule, to
whom the Goſpell comes: ſo
that euery one who heareth the
Goſpell, ought to beleeue; which
if he doe not, (which none can
without ſpeciall grace) yet this is
his ſin, and ſhall be his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for wilfull refuſing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
offered. And therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one that will not periſh muſt
beleeue, that there is ſuch mercie
in God as he offereth, and that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29133:88"/>
God is able, willing, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to performe his promiſe:
that ſo beleeuing hee may enioy
the benefite, of which otherwiſe
hee depriueth himſelfe. This
therefore I doe before hand
make knowne, that (ſeeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthie promiſes be thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
propounded and ſet out,
that wee might by beleeuing bee
made partakers of Chriſt) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none doe ſhut out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and ſo bring vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
more iuſt damnation: as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. is plainlie expreſſed,
<hi>Hee that beleeues not is condemned
alreadie. ver. 19. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
that light is come into
the world, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There bee alſo many ſpeciall
promiſes made to ſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
performing ſuch duties, as
to Faith and truſt in God, to
confeſsion of ſinne, to prayer,
and ſo to all obedience: for God
requires no dutie, but there is a
Reward belonging thereto,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29133:89"/>
(though not alwaies expreſſed)
which reward though it may
moue the heart to deſire it, yet
it cannot beget Faith; but the
truth of the promiſer muſt draw
vs to beleeue, and our beliefe of
hauing the reward which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
will moue to obedience:
And therefore euerie one who
heares ſuch rewards promiſed,
muſt bee thereby moued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
Secondly, to obey as was
before ſaid. Theſe well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
will better guide the weaker
ſort, to applie and make the right
vſe of all the promiſes in the
Scripture, which may any way
concerne them.</p>
            <p>Now then becauſe theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
be exceeding many, wee
muſt needs bring them to ſome
order, and that as plaine and
ſhort as may be, leſt the weaker
memories be ouer-loaden, and ſo
their vnderſtanding confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by many diuiſions, as is too
oft ſeene. I cannot thinke of any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29133:89"/>
more eaſie way, to teach the full
vſe of our faith in euery part of
our liues, then to laie open the
moſt principall matters, in which
we are moſt ſubiect to doubt and
feare; that ſeeing our diſeaſes, we
may more fitly applie the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>Ouerlooking the whole courſe
of life,<note place="margin">Order.</note> I obſerue theſe ſixe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
occaſions of doubting,
wherein we haue moſt need to be
releeued by Faith.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt and aboue all,<note place="margin">6. Choiſe heads.</note> we are
moſt ſubiect to doubt, whether
we be in the ſtate of grace, and ſo
of the number of thoſe that ſhall
be ſaued by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, how wee ſhall be
able to ouercome our ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and temptations.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, how to get grace
to praie, heare the word, and to
performe all duties to God and
man in faith, ſo as God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, how to endure
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29133:90"/>
and profite by all afflictions and
perſecutions.</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly, how to be prouided
for, of all things needfull for this
naturall life.</p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, how wee ſhall hold
out to the end.</p>
            <p>All which may bee drawne to
two heads, firſt for our ſpirituall
life, ſecondly for this bodilie
life: In both which, were wee ſo
ſtrengthened in Faith, as to reſt
vpon God for all ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
I well ſee not what might
be much wanting to make vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
alwaies in the Lord; and
ſure I am, no other ſtate in this
life, herewith were to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Let vs therefore come to
particulars, and ſee how in all of
theſe wee may gather out of
Gods word ſtrength of Faith,
and ſo comfort to our ſoules, for
the better finiſhing of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
in this life, and more full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of our finall victorie
and glorie hereafter, in and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29133:90"/>
through our Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>And now to begin with that,<note place="margin">Firſt point wherein we liue by Faith, is for aſſurance of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note>
which as it is firſt in order, ſo is
it in degree aboue all to be moſt
ſought for (ſeeing vpon it all the
reſt doe depend,) and yet we are
vſually in nothing more wanting,
namely to be ſure of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Chriſt; vnder which I doe
containe eſpeciallie our Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by which we be made Gods
children. All which, as wee haue

in Chriſt, and to be made ours,
only by Faith,<note place="margin">Titus 3. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

done.</hi> Whereof, although there
hath beene in the former part of
this Treatiſe, ſo much ſaid as
might ſuffiſe for this point, to
ſhew how this Faith is attained:
yet ſeeing the Lord hath left vs
ſo many promiſes in the holie
Scriptures, (ſpeciallie in the new
Teſtament, wherein Chriſt who
was before ſhadowed in Types,
is more cleerelie reuealed, for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29133:91"/>
which cauſe I doe chiefly cite
theſe.) And ſeeing this is my
maine ſcope, to teach the weake
beleeuer, how hee may by theſe
promiſes dailie nouriſh his faith,
(ſpecially in time of tentation)
I hope it will be found no loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to gather ſome ſtore of
theſe promiſes, and to ſhew the

            <p>To come then to the practiſe
of this firſt point, how wee may
dailie come to more certaintie,
that wee bee reconciled to God,
and ſo his adopted children and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ertentie.</note>
that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
certaintie, or aſſurance of
Gods fauour,<note place="margin">1. Of faith.</note> one the certaintie
which comes by Faith alone,<note place="margin">2. Senſe.</note> the

The other is the certaintie of
ſenſe, when as we haue ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

manifeſted to vs by his manifold
graces beſtowed on vs, which be
ſo many tokens and teſtimonies,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29133:91"/>
of his Fatherlie loue. A cleare
reſemblance whereof, may bee
that which <hi>Ioab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid:</hi>

wee ſee <hi>Ioab</hi> was more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

In all of which wee ſhall finde

            <p>And firſt concerning Chriſt
and the benefites brought by
him,<note place="margin">Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</note> wee may well begin with
that, which was the firſt promiſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29133:92"/>
made to man, and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all others, where the Lord
denouncing his vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Serpent (the deuils
inſtrument in ſeducing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde)
ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>And I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betweene thee and the woman,
and betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed:
It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou
ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> In which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſundrie other things there
intended, this is chiefe for our
purpoſe; that Chriſt the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſeed of the woman ſhould
fullie conquer Sathan, and his
whole kingdome, howſoeuer
Sathan would continually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
the ſeede of the woman,
till hee were quite vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſelfeſame matter is more
plainelie taught, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. that
Chriſt tooke our nature, <hi>That
through death hee might deſtroy
him that had the power of death,
that is, the Deuill. And deliuer
them, who for feare of death, were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29133:93"/>
all their life ſubiect to bondage.</hi>
Which (if God had made
no other promiſe) might bee
a ſufficient word, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
euery ſoule that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it, not onely to deſire,
and ſeeke this deliuerance by
Chriſt, but to beleeue that hee
ſhall enioy it, ſeeing God hath ſo
faithfully ſaid it. For the further
confirmation of the faith of gods
people in this point, in all ages
the Lord renewed this promiſe
of ſending Chriſt the promiſed
ſeede. As immediatly after the
flood, <hi>Noah</hi> by Propheſie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <hi>In thy ſeede

to <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> and to <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo;

In all which Chriſt was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

ſo forward in all ſucceeding ages,
<hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets in

as we reade, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 24. 10. 43.
So that it is needeleſſe to write
all the ſcriptures tending to this
point.</p>
            <p>All this ſerues thus to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the faith of all that will giue
credit to God,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that ſeeing the
Lord nouriſhed the faith of his
Church from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt,
with thoſe promiſes of ſaluation
by Chriſt, the promiſed ſeede; we
therfore may boldly reſt hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; much the rather, ſeeing we
vnder the Goſpel, haue all things
fulfilled, which they vnder the
former Teſtament ſawe a farre
off,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13</note> and were perſwaded <hi>of them,
and embraced them.</hi> To paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
then all the promiſes of the

Chriſt &amp; his benefits, &amp; to come
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29133:94"/>
to the new,<note place="margin">Multitude of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt</note> wherein all things
which were foretolde, are fully

               <hi>the

promiſes, wherein Chriſt and
his benefites bee ſet foorth vnto
vs, that the bare rehearſing of
them, without any further ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, would make a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
book, and longer I feare,
then any of our idle profeſſours
would once reade ouer. I intend
therefore to range theſe into
ſome order, and to make choice
of ſome principall of euery ſort,
and by them to ſhew how wee
may make vſe of the reſt, that are
of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this firſt point, for the
ſtrengthening of our faith in the
aſſurance of our ſaluation by
Chriſt, be propounded either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
or more ſpecially, as was

            </p>
            <p>Generally,<note place="margin">Perſons.</note> in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29133:94"/>
promiſed, as that Chriſt ſhall
ſaue vs and the like; as alſo of
the perſons, to whom theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
be performed: that is, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to all mankinde. Both
which be for the moſt part ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together, what is promiſed,
and to whom; therefore we will
handle them together for breuity
ſake, leaſt otherwiſe wee ſhould
be faine to alleage the ſame ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
againe, to ſundry purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
which would bee tedious,
which I deſire to auoide. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
then with the very names,
which throughout the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
bee giuen to our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ieſus Chriſt: they are both
of great force to confirme our
faith. When the angell <hi>Gabriel</hi>
was ſent from God to the <hi>Virgin
Mary,</hi> with that heauenly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he told her, <hi>That ſhe ſhould

               <note place="margin">Ieſus.</note> Whereof the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt

               <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21.</note> and to like effect oft,
<hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the ſaluation of
God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 6. 1</note> When Chriſt came to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
he ſaide, <hi>This day is ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
come to this houſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">19. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>for as much
as he alſo is the ſonne of Abraham;
for the Sonne of man is come to ſeek,
and to ſaue that which is loſt.</hi> Chriſt
himſelfe ſaide,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>God ſent not his
Sonne into the world to condemne
the world, but that the world
through him ſhould be ſaued.</hi> And
againe, <hi>I came not to iudge the
world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. 47.</note> 
               <hi>but to ſaue the world,</hi> And
to heape vp no more of this ſort,
to this end is Chriſt to oft called
our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>In all which we ought to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thus,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> Seeing the eternall Son
of God did take mans nature,
and ſo was <hi>Immanuel</hi> God with
vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 23.</note> as the Euangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 7. 14.</note>
ſheweth out of the Prophet, and
that to this end, to ſaue vs being
loſt, and not to condemne <hi>the
world, but to ſaue the world:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29133:95"/>
vnleſſe we will thinke all this
is but a fable, we are vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beleeue, that there is in this
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> and in him alone ſaluation
for vs ſinners:<note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>For there is no other
name vnder heauen giuen among
men, whereby wee muſt bee ſaued.</hi>
And further, if wee will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
this wonderfull mercy of
God in ſending his Sonne, and
of Chriſt himſelfe, in comming
into the world, not to condemne
vs, but to ſaue vs being loſt: then
muſt we with a true faith accept
this mercy. The ſame may bee
ſaide of the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt.</note> (vnto
both which all his other names
may be referred) which ſignifieth
Annointed, whereto anſwereth
the word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
By both which (beeing referred
to Chriſt) is meant, that the Son
of God taking our nature, was in
the ſame filled with the Holy
Ghoſt, (as is oft ſaide of him)
and that farre aboue all other
holy men, as was propheſied of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29133:96"/>
him, <hi>Pſal. 45. 7. Thou loueſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
&amp; hateſt wickednes; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God thy God hath annointed
thee with the oyle of gladneſſe aboue
thy fellowes.</hi> Of which the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
<hi>Iohn</hi> more plainely ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 34.</note>
               <hi>For God giueth not the ſpirit by
meaſure vnto him;</hi> which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
ſhewed at Chriſts bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
where the Holy Ghoſt
<hi>deſcended in a bodily ſhape like a
doue vpon him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 22.</note> 
               <hi>and a voyce came
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, which ſaid, Thou art my
beloued Son, in thee I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
Which was to this end, that
as vnder the Law, <hi>the Prophets,
Prieſts, and Kings were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their offices by the annointing
with the holy oyle:</hi> ſo Chriſt was
conſecrated to the offices of his
mediation, 1. to be our Prophet,
to reueale the whole will of God
for our ſaluation. 2. to bee our
high Prieſt, both to offer vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to God his Father, a full and
ſufficient ſacrifice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of vs ſinners, and to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29133:96"/>
make intercesſion for vs. 3. to be
our King to rule and gouerne his
people, and to ſubdue all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
All which bee notably ſet
out in that worthy epiſtle to the
<hi>Hebrewes,</hi> which beeing too long
to recite, I deſire the Chriſtian
reader to reade with obſeruation
that epiſtle to this end.</p>
            <p>From whence another effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
motiue to beleeue,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> may bee
thus taken: Seeing God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath thus annointed his Son
in our nature, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Chriſt, and filled him
with the Holy Ghoſt without
meaſure, that he might performe
all things needfull for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
all which he hath fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed:
wee may therefore
boldly come to him, and ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
reſt vpon him for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
And on the other ſide,
they who hearing theſe, bee not
drawne heereby to beleeue in
Chriſt for their ſaluation, doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny the truth of theſe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29133:97"/>
(which is to make God a lyar)
or deſpiſe their owne ſaluation,
ſo prepared and offered to them;
which ſhall bring vpon them
moſt iuſt condemnation. And
theſe briefly for thoſe two names
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> properly belonging
to our Sauiour, which doe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
containe all, and ſo to a
wiſe regarder hereof might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe
to perſwade him, to reſt vpon
Chriſt for ſaluation.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord (who
knowes how hardly wee bee
brought to this aſſurance by faith
of our ſaluation by Chriſt) hath
in that ſmall volume of the new
Teſtament, ſpoken ſo much of
Chriſt and the benefites which
hee hath brought vnto vs, to
this end that wee might bee
more ſtirred vp to ſeeke to him,
and to embrace him for our
Sauiour: I hope it ſhall bee
worth our labour further to
conſider what the Lord ſaith.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29133:97"/>
And before I come to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
let vs heare, and wonder
at <hi>theſe heapes of heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Generall benefits by Chriſt.</note>
which bee brought to
ſinners in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Wherein this is the firſt,<note place="margin">Saueth vs.</note> 
               <hi>that
Chriſt is ſent to ſaue ſinners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 32.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
enough was ſpoken before in
the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> therefore now no
more thereof.</p>
            <p>The next is, that Chriſt is ſaid
to bee <hi>a light to the Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Light to Gent.</note>
which was long before prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed
often times by the Prophet
<hi>Eſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 9. 2. 42. 6. 49. 6. 60. 3.</note> ſaying: <hi>The people that
walke in darkneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>haue ſeene a
great light, they that dwell in the
land of the ſhadow of death, vpon
them is the light ſhined:</hi> which
the Euangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
to Chriſt, bringing the
light of the Goſpell, to a blind
and ignorant people: And the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alleadgeth for his
warrant in preaching the Goſpel
to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:29133:98"/>
To like effect, Chriſt is often
ſaid to be <hi>the light of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48.</note> as
he profeſſeth of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 12. 9. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I am the
light of the world.</hi> And of this I
vnderſtand that which is ſpoken
by the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn, 1. 9. That
Chriſt was that true light which
lighteth euery man that commeth
into the world,</hi> (that is:) who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
out the light of the Goſpell
to all nations, as the ſunne in the
firmament ſhines to al the world,
though many blind neuer ſee the
light thereof. Vnder this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of light, all the benefites
which Chriſt brings vs be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
light of knowledge, light of
grace, and holy life, and light of
eternall life and glory. All which
be contained either generally or
ſpecially in the former alleadged
ſcriptures, and in ſundry others.
To this head alſo belongs ſuch
ſcriptures as ſhew Chriſt to bee
our life, <hi>Ioh. 6. 33. 51. 10. 10. 14.
6. 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Of all which this is the vſe we<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:29133:98"/>
are to make, that ſeeing God
hath ſet vp his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt
in the miniſtery of the Goſpell,
to all nations, where euer it
comes, to lighten, and to giue
life to euery man who heareth it,
if he refuſe it not, and ſhut not
his eyes againſt it, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
did: Therefore euery one
who heareth this,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 41.</note> not only may,
but is bound to embrace this
light,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 36.</note> by a true faith, that ſo they
may be the children of the light,
and that vpon paine of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
euen as our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
denounceth againſt all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers,
ſaying: <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
that light is come into
the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and men loue darkeneſſe
rather then light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another worthy ground for
our faith is this, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when at the baptizing of
Chriſt, hee ſent downe his Holy
Spirit in the likeneſſe of a doue,<note place="margin">3. God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Chriſt.</note>
lighting vpon him, ſent a voyce
from heauen, ſaying: <hi>This is my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29133:99"/>
beloued Sonne, in whom I am well
pleaſed;</hi> Wherein is meant not
onely that God did loue and like
well his Sonne, (with whom for
himſelfe hee could neuer bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
there beeing no cauſe
why) but this rather, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God was extreamely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with all mankinde, now hee
was fully appeaſed by Chriſt,
and for his ſake ready to receiue
into fauour, all that by Faith
ſhould receiue him; and ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
him for vs, and vs in him:
which is the ſame with that,
where it is ſaide, God hath made
vs accepted <hi>in his beloued.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 6. 5. 2.</note> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>That Chriſt hath giuen
himſelfe for vs, an offering and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God for a ſweete ſmelling
ſauour:</hi> meaning that whereas
whole mankinde ſince the fall, is
become odious to God for ſin,
ſo that neither their perſons, nor
their workes could be acceptable
to God; now by this all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſacrifice of Chriſt, all that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29133:99"/>
lay hold on Chriſt by faith, and
ſo apply his ſacrifice to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
they ſhall bee accepted of
God, and their obedience plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to God, in his perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Which alone is a ſufficient
meanes by the operation of the
Holy Ghoſt, to drawe any that
heare and conceiue this, to caſt
themſelues wholy vpon Chriſt,
and to ſeeke for Gods fauour,
and all the fruits thereof onely in
this ſacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there bee many
other Scriptures, which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

            <p>And this ſhall ſuffiſe to haue
ſet out ſome of the generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and the vſe of them, how
wee are to ſtrengthen our faith
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29133:100"/>
by them.</p>
            <p>Onely this I will adde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
theſe,<note place="margin">When ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall want, make vſe of generall.</note> that if at any time in
our doubts and feares for any
particular diſtreſſe, wee cannot
readily remember ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
promiſe, whereby wee might
bee comforted; then wee may
ſafely runne to one of theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
promiſes, (which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
all particulars) and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to our preſent neede. As
for example, if any poore ſoule
ſhould fall into great doubtings
of Gods fauour, by reaſon of
ſome great affliction that lay
heauy vpon him, or ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
which he could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
and in this perplexity could
not thinke of any ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
whereout hee might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome comfort: then may he
boldly lay hold vpon any one of
theſe generall promiſes, and reſt
thereupon for comfort, in this
maner: O Lord thou haſt ſaid in
thy holy word (which is the word
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29133:101"/>
of truth) that the Sonne of man
is come to <hi>ſaue that which is loſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 10.</note>
Lord I am loſt, and ſee nothing
in my ſelfe to helpe mee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do wholly reſt vpon Chriſt
and looke for helpe only by him.
The ſame may bee ſaid of all the
generall promiſes, the leaſt of
which contain matter enough to
ſupport vs in all our feares, if we
could fitly apply them.</p>
            <p>Wherein I doe againe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
euery one who deſires to
beleeue in God,<note place="margin">Looke for nothing in thy ſelfe, to cauſe thee to beleeue.</note> and ſo to liue by
his faith, aboue all to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and not to looke for any
thing in himſelfe, why he ſhould
beleeue (which I haue obſerued
to bee a maine hinderance from
true beleeuing:) but to caſt all
our thoughts vpon God: Firſt,
how mercifull hee is to prouide
ſuch helpe, for poore ſinners in
Chriſt, and freely to offer it vnto
them in his word: and ſecondly,
how faithfull hee is to performe
all that he hath ſaid, that by this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29133:101"/>
meanes the poore ſinner may bee
mooued to beleeue in God, that
he will ſurely ſuccour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him in due ſeaſon and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Thus would I now paſſe from
theſe generall promiſes,<note place="margin">For the perſons, to whom, firſt to all.</note> and
come to the ſpeciall, but that I
feare I haue not ſufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one point concerning theſe
generals: namely, for the perſons,
to whom God preacheth and
proclaimeth theſe mercies, that
they may beleeue (I ſpeake not
here, who ſhall enioy theſe, who
be only beleeuers and their ſeed,
but to whom theſe bee offered.)
From whence be raiſed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
doubts in many for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to bee of that number, to
whom God doth truely offer
theſe mercies: and no maruell.
For as it is not posſible, for a
rebell againſt his Soueraigne, to
beleeue he ſhall be pardoned, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he be ſure that hee is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29133:102"/>
vnder the Princes pardon: ſo
no ſinner can beleeue to haue
pardon, till he know that he is in
the number of thoſe, to whom the
pardon is proclaimed by God in
the Goſpell, for the knowledge
wherof either there muſt be ſome
ſpecial marke of difference wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may be knowne, to whom
the pardon is proclaimed, and to
whom not, or els it muſt bee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to all. But there is no ſuch
ſpeciall certaine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſinners before faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
one may know the pardon is
granted to him, and ſuch as he is,
and not to any other: for then
might ſome know themſelues to
bee vnder Gods ſpeciall fauour,
that is, elected before he beleeue,
which is imposſible by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
meanes: therfore of necesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the onely way whereby anie
may know himſelfe to be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnder the pardon, is this, that
he heares that God in his Goſpel
doth proclaime forgiueneſſe of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29133:102"/>
ſinne in Chriſt, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to all ſinners, that whoſoeuer
heareth and beleeueth ſhall bee
ſaued; the reſt ſhall bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for not beleeuing, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
this mercy offered to
them. Hauing in the former part
of this Treatiſe ſufficiently proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by many Scriptures, this
point, that <hi>Chriſt and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
be freely offred without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all mankinde,</hi> as that one
place, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. expreſly
ſheweth: I only now aduiſe euery
one, who is kept from beleeuing
by this, that he knowes not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he bee contained vnder the
pardon or no, not to looke to
Gods ſecret will, but to attend to
Gods reuealed will in his word,
wherein it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>That
God would haue no man to periſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3 9.</note>
               <hi>but would haue all men to come to

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29133:103"/>
which God is ſo willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
vpon vpon him, if the fault
be not in his owne ſelfe, as it was
in the vnbeleeulng Iewes in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>

               </note>
may be ſeene in his gracious

come to the wedding of his Son;
yea more by his beſeeching ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to be reconciled to him:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20</note> and
by the many and weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he vſeth to perſwade men
to beleeue, by the great rewards,
earthly, and ſpirituall, temporall,
and eternall, which all beleeuers
ſhall enioy; and by the fearefull
woes which ſhall fall on all vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
both in this life, and that
to come,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 38. 3. 18.</note> as plentifully is to bee

            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:29133:103"/>
Out of all this, mee thinkes, a
poore diſtreſſed ſinner, might
thus ſtirre vp himſelfe to beleeue.
If this bee certaine,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that God
would not haue me periſh, but is
very willing to ſaue me, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath not onely prouided all
ſufficient meanes to bring mee
thereto, and made ſuch a generall
pardon, as may aſſure mee I am
contained vnder it: yea ſeeing I
now know, that I am inuited and
called to come to Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to bee friends with God,
then may I be bold to come and
aſſure my ſelf, I ſhal be welcome.
Yea further, if I will not forgoe
all theſe rich rewards tendered
vnto me, and pull vpon my ſelfe
moſt iuſtly all thoſe woes which
God hath threatned againſt all
deſpiſers of his mercies, then
muſt I gladly accept Gods mercy
offered to mee; and if I finde my
vnbeleeuing heart to draw back,
then muſt I ply the Lord with
feruent and conſtant prayers,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29133:104"/>
that hee would draw mee by his
Spirit to come to Chriſt, and ſo
to reſt vpon him for my ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And thus much for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
promiſes, both in regard of
the matters promiſed, and of the
perſons to whom they bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
that euery one who
heares them, may claime his
part in them.<note place="margin">Speciall benefits.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now to come to thoſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
benefites which we receiue in
Chriſt, which belong to this firſt
point, how our faith is to bee
ſtrengthened in the aſſurance of
our ſaluation by Chriſt: I intend
to referre all that I haue to ſay
herein, to theſe two, 1. our <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and 2. the fruites immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
growing from thence,
which I gather out of the Apoſtle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. to bee theſe three, 1.
<hi>Reconciliation, 2. Adoption, 3. Hope
of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Iustification,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> it is
euident by the Scripture, that all
our ſaluation depends vpon it,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29133:104"/>
that whoſoeuer ſhall bee ſaued,
muſt be iuſtified: and therefore
of necesſity, he that is not iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
muſt needs bee condemned; it
behooueth then euery one who
lookes for ſaluation, well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
what it is to be iuſtified in
Gods ſight; and then to make
ſure worke, that hee may attaine
it: yea and know it alſo, that hee
is iuſtified: without which, is no
comfort or hope of happineſſe.
To be iuſtified before God, is to
be made righteous: that is, not
onely without all ſinne, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
all that righteouſnes which
God in his holy law requireth,
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. So was <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eue</hi> by creation:<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 31.</note> 
               <hi>God made man
righteous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note> So was Chriſt, <hi>Such an
high Prieſt it became vs to haue,
who is holy, harmeleſſe, vndefiled,
ſeparate from ſinners, and made
higher then the heauens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, not one of the
whole ſtocke of mankinde, was
thus righteous, but euery ſoule,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29133:105"/>
young and old, was, is, and euer
ſhall be in this world, voyde of
this righteouſneſſe, and full of all
vnrighteouſneſſe: As <hi>Rom. 3. 20.
Therefore by the workes of the law
ſhall no fleſh be iustified in his ſight.</hi>
It followeth then, that all that
ſhall be ſaued, muſt bee iuſtified
another way, and that is this, by
hauing that perfect righteouſnes
which was in Chriſt alone, to bee
accounted theirs, as if it had been
in themſelues.</p>
            <p>Not intending to enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further diſcours hereof, which
may bee ſeene in ſundry Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
written of this argument; all
our care muſt bee, to get this
grace in Chriſt, whereby we ſhal
aſſuredly be ſaued. The Scripture
is cleare that this is obtained by
faith, and no way elſe, as beſides
ſundry other ſcriptures, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
both ſoundly and plentifully
prooueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. reade
the places, in which wee ſhall ſee
not onely the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29133:105"/>
but many motiues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and imbrace this grace
wrought by Chriſt for vs, and
by him freely offered vnto vs,
that we might receaue it to our
comfort.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe is that which
is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. verſ. 21. 22. <hi>But
now is the righteouſneſſe of God,
made manifeſt without the Law,
hauing witneſſe of the Law and
the Prophets, to wit, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God, by the faith of Ieſus
Chriſt, vnto all, and vpon all that
beleeue.</hi> And ſo forward to the
end of the chapter; wherein for
our purpoſe, this is chiefly to be
conſidered, That as none are
partakers of this benefite of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
in Chriſt, but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers:
ſo ſeeing none can beleeue
to enioy this, but ſuch as know
that God freely and faithfully
offers it to them, therefore it is
here, and elſewhere oft reuealed,
that as <hi>all haue ſinned and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of the glory of God,</hi> ſo are
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29133:106"/>
they <hi>iuſtified feeely by his grace,
through the Redemption that is in
Christ Jeſus.</hi> Which (as I ſaid)
cannot bee vnderſtood, that all
doe receiue this mercie of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
purchaſed by Chriſt;
but that as Chriſt hath wrought
it, ſo God doth indifferently offer
it in the Goſpell to all: which is
more manifeſted by the words
following, verſe 25. <hi>Whom God
hath ſet forth to bee a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through faith in his blood, to
declare his righteouſneſſe by the
forgiueneſſe of ſinnes that are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe to bee made of theſe,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>
and the like, for the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our Faith, in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our ſaluation by Chriſt,
is this; that euery one who would
beleeue, doe ſet before him, on
the one ſide his owne ſinfulneſſe
and curſedneſſe, to be ſuch, that
he is no way able to make any
ſatisfaction whereby he might be
deliuered: on the other ſide, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29133:106"/>
Chriſt hath made a full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vnto his Father for him a
miſerable ſinner, and freely offers
it to him; which if hee beleeue,
it ſhall be accepted for him, and
he thereby ſaued: that this may
draw him, to renounce all hope
in himſelfe, and ſo to relie vpon
Chriſt for his Iuſtification and
ſaluation.</p>
            <p>This ſhall be more manifeſt in
the parts of Iuſtification,<note place="margin">Parts of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which
are <hi>forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Forgiuenes of ſinne.</note> 
               <hi>and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of righteouſneſſe:</hi> and
more eſpecially in the former,
<hi>forgiueneſſe of ſinne,</hi> which ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
bringing in the latter
imputation of righteouſneſſe,
the Scripture doth moſt labour
to aſſure vs of. And for this cauſe
all bleſſedneſſe is worthily placed
herein, both by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities
are forgiuen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>and whoſe ſinnes are
couered.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man, to
whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne.</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:29133:107"/>
That it may driue euery man out
of himſelfe for happineſſe, ſeeing
<hi>God iuſtifieth the vngodly,</hi> verſe 5:
and to draw all that ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
to looke for ſaluation, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Gods free mercy, forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their iniquitie, and couering
their ſinne, and not imputing to
them their ſinne. Vnder which
ſpeeches is contained the way
and meanes, how the righteous
God (who will not let one ſinne
and breach of his Law to eſcape
vnpuniſhed, without deſerued
condemnation) doth yet ſet free
poore ſinners, from their ſinne
and puniſhment: which is onely
by the ſatisfaction, which Chriſt
hath made for them, in bearing
their puniſhment; wherwith God
being ſatisfied, doth fully and
freely forgiue all thoſe who by
Faith accept this mercie offered
vnto them.</p>
            <p>To this end throughout the
Scripture, is this great benefite
of forgiuenes of ſinne by Chriſt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29133:107"/>
ſo plentifully proclamed vnto vs
miſerable ſinners; I wil cite a few
for many. When <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
was ſent to prepare way for
Chriſt, firſt ſeeing Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
vnto him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> hee cried out, <hi>Behold
the Lambe of God, which taketh
away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> Our
Sauiour himſelfe after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
appearing to two of his
Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 24. 45.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
opened their vnderſtanding
that they might vnderſtand the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">46.</note> ſaid vnto them, <hi>Thus
it is written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">47.</note> 
               <hi>and thus it behoued
Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe againe

to the Iewes in their Synagogues
ſaid vnto them, <hi>Be it knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 4.</note>
And ſo all the reſt of the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> in which it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note>
that Chriſt was <hi>Deliuered to
death for our ſinnes:</hi>

               <hi>That he bare our

And to ſhut vp all with that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
ſaying of Saint <hi>John, If any

               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>wee haue an Aduocate
with the Father, Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
And <hi>he is the propitiation for
our ſinnes, and not for ours onely;
but for the ſinnes of the whole
world.</hi> In all of which, what can
any man thinke to be Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
but to prouide a meanes to
ſaue vs ſinners? And therefore
whoſoeuer feeles his ſinne, and
feares Gods wrath, may boldly
come to Chriſt, and ſtedfaſtly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29133:108"/>
beleeue that God for Chriſts
ſake will forgiue him, <hi>and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his ſinnes no more.</hi> And ſo
much the more, may and ought
euery one, to whom this good
newes of pardon is brought by
the preaching of the Goſpell,
lay claime to this pardon, and ſo
ſhall hee pleaſe God and ſaue his
owne ſoule; otherwiſe as his ſin
ſhall bee exceeding great, ſo
ſhall his damnation bee more
grieuous.</p>
            <p>I doe therefore againe exhort
euery poore ſoule who faine
would beleeue, not to make his
ſinne greater then Gods mercy:
but ſeeing Chriſt hath borne the
puniſhment of his ſinne, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeaſed Gods wrath for
him, and doth expreſly call him,
and proclaime this pardon vnto
him; therefore that hee commit
himſelfe to Chriſt, and ſo giue
glorie to God in beleeuing, that
through Chriſt his debt is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
and he freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29133:109"/>
ſo that neither God
will, nor the deuill, nor his owne
conſcience, ſhall be able to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to his charge: then
which what can bee more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to a diſtreſſed ſinner, I
know not.</p>
            <p>This might content vs, if wee
were not ſo full of vnbeleefe: but
the Lord both knowing, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
our diſtruſtfull hearts, hath
ſaid much more to perſwade vs
of our ſaluation in and by our
Lord Chriſt Ieſus. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
wee haue learned that to the
iuſtifying of a ſinner, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
not onely that his ſinne
and puniſhment bee quite taken
away, but that hee haue perfect
righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">2. part of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> without which
there can be no life: for although
theſe two bee neuer parted (no
more then ſoule and body in a
liuing man) yet they be not both
one,<note place="margin">Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</note> but neceſſarily diſtinguiſhed,
and both required in him that is
iuſtified in Gods ſight. The Lord
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29133:109"/>
therefore hath graciouſly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a meanes, whereby we (who
ſince the fall of our firſt parents,
haue vtterly loſt our originall
righteouſneſſe, and bee no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to attaine ſuch righteouſneſſe
as God in iuſtice requires at our
hands) may recouer our loſſe &amp;
be made perfectly righteous, ſuch
as God will allow, and for which
hee will in his iuſtice grant eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. As <hi>Paul</hi> in his glorious

did boldly profeſſe:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 6.</note>

               <hi>I

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe,
which the Lord the righteous
Iudge ſhall giue me at that day,
and not to me onely, but to all that
loue his appearing.</hi> Which one
Scripture might ſuffiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
vs, to looke for this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and eternall life, which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29133:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by due debt (through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and the merit of Chriſt) is
made ours. But becauſe this is
not ſo eaſily ſeene, much leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
that ſuch as we ſhall euer
attaine to this high dignitie, the
Lord hath reuealed his good will
towards vs ſinners in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
that he hath prepared ſuch
a perfect righteouſneſſe for vs,
and made a faithfull &amp; free grant
therof vnto vs, that ſo wee may
make it our owne by Faith. This
is moſt manifeſt, in that heauenly
compariſon, betweene the firſt
<hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>
Chriſt Ieſus, ſet forth at large
and in many degrees, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12,
to the end. The ſumme of all is
this, that the benefite we haue in
Chriſt, doth euery way exceede
all the hurt we had in <hi>Adam,</hi> as
the Apoſtle himſelfe ſaith, verſe
20. <hi>Where ſinne abounded, grace
did much more abound, v. 21. That
as ſinne had reigned vnto death, ſo
might grace alſo reigne by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29133:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto eternall life through
Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Where wee
ſee that as ſinne through Gods
iuſtice brought death: ſo by
Gods mercy, the righteouſneſſe
of Chriſt brought to vs eternall
life. As is expreſly ſaid verſe 19.
<hi>For as by one mans diſobedience
many were made ſinners: ſo by the
obedience of one ſhall many be made
righteous.</hi> Wherin it is cleere, that
as Chriſt by his obedience was
perfectly righteous, ſo by it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(that is, all) that by Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Chriſt, are made righteous
in Gods ſight. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is ſaid that wee are made
the righteouſneſſe of God in
him.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21</note> And that of the Prophet
<hi>Eſa.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 11.</note> 
               <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my

for hee ſhall beare their iniquities.</hi>
And for this cauſe is Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 6. 33. 16.</note>
and that he is <hi>the end of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note>
               <hi>for righteouſneſſe to euery one that
beleeueth.</hi> And for this cauſe are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29133:111"/>
the Sacraments ſaid to <hi>be ſeales of
the righteouſnes of Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. 11.</note> &amp; to the
ſame intent much: wherein wee
ſee how plainely and plentifully
the Lord ſets out this perfect
righteouſneſſe, and life thereby
in Chriſt, to be made ours.
Which if any ſhall but neglect,
and paſſe by, and not accept,
how ſhall hee eſcape moſt iuſt
condemnation? As wee reade
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. ſpeaking of the ſame
matter.</p>
            <p>How then can this but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
euery one,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> who deſires ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
with both hands (as wee
ſay) to receiue this great gift of
Chriſts righteouſneſſe to bee his:
wherevpon depends ſo certainly
his eternall happineſſe. And how
iuſtly ſhalt thou periſh, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of this great goodneſſe of
God, prepared in Chriſt, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Goſpell to thee, and
yet wilt not receiue it? but either
ſecurely neglect it, or at leaſt by
thy vnbeleefe, depriue thy ſelfe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29133:111"/>
of ſo incomparable a benefite. I
can ſay no more to perſwade
thee: but I beſeech the Lord to
perſwade thee, and doe thou
giue the Lord no reſt, till by his
Spirit he draw thee, to embrace
this benefite, to thy euerlaſting
comfort.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the fruites of
Iuſtification,<note place="margin">Fruites of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which bee ſo many
effects of Gods grace accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
and following our Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
1. <hi>Reconciliation, 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi>
and 3. <hi>Hope of Glorie:</hi>
I am not ignorant that theſe bee
ſet in another order diuerſly, by
diuers Diuines, which is not
much materiall; for all conſent,
that they bee ſpeciall benefites,
which Chriſt hath purchaſed for
vs by his death and obedience,
and ſerue much for the aſſurance
of our ſaluation. Whereas on
the contrarie the ignorance or
doubting of them, muſt needes
breed much diſcomfort, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in time of temptation, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29133:112"/>
at the houre of death. Yet ſeeing
theſe doe ſo depend vpon the
former of our Iuſtification, that
hee who is iuſtified cannot want
theſe; and without a man be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
he can neuer enioy any of
them, either to bee at peace with
God, much leſſe to come into ſo
high fauour, as to bee adopted
and made Gods childe and heire
of all his bleſsings; and leſt of all,
attaine ſuch hope of euerlaſting
glorie with God in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as might make him here
in this vale of miſerie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to cheere vp his heart in the
expectation thereof, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to reioyce, and holilie to
boaſt thereof: ſeeing, I ſay, the
iuſtified man, and none elſe hath
theſe moſt certainly, the beſt
way to get aſſurance of theſe, is
to make ſure our Iuſtification, in
ſuch ſort as hath beene already
ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Scriptures doe
oft make mention of theſe, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29133:112"/>
God hath prepared and offered
theſe to vs in Chriſt: it ſhall bee
to our comfort to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them, and ſo labour for
the right vſe of them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that I haue in the former
part of this Treatiſe, ſpoken of
theſe effects of our faith, out of
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, &amp;c. to ſet out the great
and pretious fruites which are
gotten by Faith, thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
all, more to labour for
Faith: I may now be the more
briefe, eſpecially ſeeing the
Scripture including them in the
former, is not ſo plentifull as in
the former. For the firſt of
theſe,<note place="margin">Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> I vnderſtand,
that whereas before wee were in
Chriſt; we were enemies to God
by reaſon of ſinne. Now by
Chriſt wee are reconciled and
made friends, as <hi>Rom. 5. 10. For
if when wee were enemies we were
reconciled by the death of his Son,
much more being reconciled wee
ſhall be ſaued by his life.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29133:113"/>
notably is this ſet forth,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. All things
are of God, who hath reconciled
the world vnto himſelfe by Ieſus
Chriſt, and hath giuen vs the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of Reconciliation. For God
was in Chriſt, and reconciled the
world vnto himſelfe, not imputing
their ſinnes vnto them; and hath
committed to vs the word of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.
Now then are wee
ambaſſadours of Chriſt: As though
God did beſeech you through vs, we
pray you in Chriſt ſtead, that yee
bee reconciled to God.</hi> In both
which Scriptures theſe two
things I obſerue for our purpoſe,
firſt, that we being rancke ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God, Chriſt by his full
ſatisfaction (whereof his death
was a principall part) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
God his Father vnto
mankinde; yet not ſo, that any
haue the benefite thereof, but
they who gladly doe accept it.
The ſecond is, that ſeeing none
could ſo much as know this,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29133:113"/>
much leſſe haue warrant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
to haue any part in it:
Therefore the Apoſtle as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſpoſer of the ſecrets of
God, plainely affirmes, and for
more certaintie repeats, that this
reconciliation was wrought for
the world, that is, all mankinde,
(though againe I ſay, none but
beleeuers enioy it.) And the
more to draw vs to beleeue, that
God hath granted out a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
to preach and publiſh this
good newes of reconciliation
wrought by Chriſt betweene
God and man: and that they
ſhould by all meanes labour to
perſwade men; yea (which is
wonderfull) he ſaith that God by
his Ambaſſadours, doth intreate
them to bee reconciled to God,
that is, to accept this vnheard of
mercy offered to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things when I conſider,
I cannot but admire Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
mercie, in ſo ſeeking
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29133:114"/>
to ſaue vs his enemies, and our
brutiſh ingratitude in ſo light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
thereof: yea our ſenſles
neglect of our chiefeſt good, and
our deadly vnbeliefe; by which
we depriue out ſelues of ſo vnua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
treaſure, freely offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. What may be ſaid more to
moue our ſtonie hearts either to
deſire, or to accept ſo great
grace I well ſee not: but this I
ſee, and am ſure of, that it ſhall
be more tollerable for Turkes
and Pagans in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then for thee whoſoeuer
thou art, who liuing in the
Church, doeſt either deſpiſe or ſo
diſtruſt this bountie of the Lord,
that thou doeſt not receaue
it.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch who preferre any
worldly thing before this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
mercy, and ſo if not
groſſely reiect it, yet ſecurely
neglect it, and as ſwine trample
ſuch pretious pearles vnder their
feet:<note place="margin">Reu. 22. 11</note> I ſay no more, but <hi>hee that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29133:114"/>
is filthy let him be filthie ſtill.</hi> But
for ſuch poore ſoules, as doe
highly priſe this exceeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
to be reconciled vnto God,
and onely bee kept from it by
diſtruſtfull feares, that it is not
for them (they being ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.)
I beſeech them in the Lord,
deeply to weigh what hath beene
ſaid to draw them to beleeue, and
for an example, to ſet before
them Gods dealing with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,
of whom the Apoſtle
ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>That when they were dead in
treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> (which is as
bad as may bee, yet hee heapes
more of their wofull condition,
verſe 2. 11. 12.) <hi>yet theſe were
quickned in Chriſt:</hi> ſo likewiſe the
<hi>Coloſſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> being before their
conuerſion <hi>ſtrangers, and enemies,
becauſe their mindes were ſet on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
workes, were reconciled to God,
&amp;c.</hi> And to ſay the truth, ſo is it
with all that bee conuerted, as
<hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth of himſelfe, and all
other beleeuers before their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29133:115"/>
calling, that <hi>they had
their conuerſation in times past in
the luſts of their fleſh, in fulfilling
the will of the fleſh, &amp; of the minde,
and were by nature the children of
wrath as well as others.</hi> All which
if a poore ſinner ſhall conſider,
that others in as bad a ſtate as
he, and many farre worſe, were
receiued to mercy: and that
God doth in mercy as freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to him as them, and is as
faithfull as euer to performe
what he ſaith: this doubtleſſe will
in time moue him to expect like
mercy at Gods hands, if hee ſhall
with patience waite the Lords
leiſure, and neuer giue ouer ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſupplication to God, to draw
him, and daily meditation on
Gods mercy. Thus will I leaue
this point (hauing ſaid more
then I purpoſed:)<note place="margin">Peace.</note> only I deſire to
be conſidered, that vnder this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
I containe that
peace which Chriſt makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and vs, whereof
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29133:115"/>
               <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Eph.</hi> 2. 17. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
oft; that it may bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to this head.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the ſecond
fruite of our Iuſtification, which
is <hi>Adoption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adoption.</note> whereby I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that high fauour of God,
whereby hee maketh thoſe who
be iuſtified by Chriſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
his owne children and
heires of all his bleſsings. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
thought it no ſmall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bee ſonne in Law to
King <hi>Saul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 23.</note> what may bee
thought of this? And therefore
the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth all to an
admiration of that vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
loue of God in calling vs to
be the ſonnes of God.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we haue to conſider,
not only the excellencie of this
eſtate, but the certainetie of it,
without which we could haue no
comfort by it. This certaintie
appeares as in this, that God
hath called all true beleeuers to
be his ſonnes: ſo further in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29133:116"/>
next verſe where he ſaith, <hi>Deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloued, now are we the ſonnes of
God, though</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
not what wee ſhall bee.</hi> To
this purpoſe well ſerueth that
gracious promiſe which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
citeth out of the Prophet
<hi>Hoſea, And it ſhall be in the place
where it was ſaid vnto them:</hi>

               <hi>yee

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and yee ſhall be my ſonnes

               <note place="margin">Reu. 21. 7.</note>
Againe, <hi>Hee that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
ſhall inherit all things,
And I will be his God, and hee ſhall

be the cauſe of our faith, and our

as hath beene ſaid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid, <hi>Yee are all the ſonnes
of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note>
And yet much more to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:29133:116"/>
purpoſe, is that excellent
Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. which
containes much for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
of our faith in this
whole point of the aſſurance of
our ſaluation, therfore I rehearſe
it all: <hi>But when the fulneſſe of time
was come, God ſent forth his Sonne
made of a woman, and made vnder
the Law, that hee might redeeme
them which were vnder the Law:
that we might receiue the adoption
of ſonnes,</hi> And <hi>becauſe ye are ſonnes,
God hath ſent forth the Spirit of

that a maine end why God
ſent his Sonne to redeeme vs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſinners, (who are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

was this, that wee might by this

in the former Scripture, <hi>Gal.

            <p>If this be ſo (as the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

ſhould be the ſonnes of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> and
partakers with Chriſt of all his

            <p>But me thinkes I heare ſome

the Scripture oft witneſſeth,
that they be but few who attaine
this fauour,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> how may I who am
ſo vnworthy, ſo full of ſinne, and
voide of grace, euer hope to bee
a partaker hereof?</p>
            <p>This beeing ſo great an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and ſo common, whereby
many be kept from beleeuing, it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29133:117"/>
is meete to be well anſwered. It
hath two partes: firſt, that
ſo fewe come to bee Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to which I anſwer, firſt the
fault hereof is not in God, who
(as oft hath beene ſaid) hath ſo
largly proclaimed life in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to euery ſinner. Again, if there
were an almes of great value
caſt among many, which a few
onely could enioy, what ſcramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is there who could get it? A
memorable ſtory of late yeares,
I will relate to be a witnes againſt
all ſuch <hi>wicked ſeruants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 26</note> 
               <hi>and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
(as our Sauiour calls them)
who hearing that a few ſhall bee
ſaued, will let others ſtriue for it,
and be content to goe without it
themſelues; which is indeede, and
ſo the Lord will count it, a flatte
deſpiſing of his mercy offered
vnto them. A rich woman gaue
at her death a dole of ſixe pence
to the poore that came to Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Hall in London, for which
there was ſuch ſtriuing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were troden to death; how
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29133:118"/>
ſhall theſe riſe in iudgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our dainty, idle, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
couetous, and voluptuous
worldlings, who euery one in
their kinde, ſtriue extreamely for
their deſires, but take no paines
to be ſaued? But to leaue theſe,
and to come to the ſecond part
of the obiection, which concerns
a better ſort, and farre neerer ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
who be kepr backe by
their vnworthineſſe; whom as I
much pitty for their vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe
ſo can I no leſſe blame
for their ignorance, that after ſo
long preaching of the Goſpell,
wherein all the mercies of God
be proclaimed vnto, yea beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon ſinners, yea great, and all
vnworthy (as in the laſt point
before this was ſhewed:) yet
theeſe poore ſoules doe ſticke ſo
faſt in the mudde of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
pride of Popery, as to ſeeke
for ſome worthineſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
for which God ſhould
make them his ſonnes. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29133:118"/>
then this point, ſeeing God
is a free giuer of this high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of Adoption; and no ſeller
of it; and ſeeing he ſo freelie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it to thee in Chriſt; beware,
that neither by idleneſſe, nor

            <p>The laſt ſpeciall benefit which
we receiue from Chriſt,<note place="margin">Hope of glory.</note> as a fruit
of our iuſtification, ſeruing for
ſtrengthening of our faith in the
aſſurance of our ſaluation, is the
<hi>Hope of Glory:</hi> whereby I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that God hath prepared
for vs ſinners, this ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that wee may enioy in this
life, ſuch a hope and expectation
of euerlaſting glorie, as may both
inwardlie cheere our hearts, and
cauſe vs outwardlie to profeſſe
the ſame, to the glorie of God,
encouragement of other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people of God, amazing of

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29133:119"/>
our ſelues, to hold out to the end,
againſt al diſcouragements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer.
That God hath prouided
ſuch a ſtay, to ſupport vs in all
the changes of this life, may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appeare by that which
we reade, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 17. 18, 19. a
Scripture containing great force
for the ſtrengthening of our
faith, in the certaintie of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
as we ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p>Wherein God willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to ſhew vnto the heires of
promiſe, the immutability of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
confirmed it by an oath. That by
two immutable things, in which it
was not poſſible that God ſhould lye,
wee might haue a ſtrong conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who haue fled for refuge, to lay
holde vpon the hope ſet before vs;
which hope we haue as an anker of
the ſoule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and
which entreth into that which is
within the vaile, whither the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
is for vs entered, euen Ieſus
made an high Prieſt after the order
of Melchiſedech. <hi>Wherein bee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29133:119"/>
theſe heauenly matters contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which I wil only laie open, &amp;
ſo gather out that which makes
moſt for our preſentintention, to
make vs more ſure of this grace,
the hope of glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Gods decree and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<hi>counſell</hi> concerning our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
is <hi>vnchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It was Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to make this exceedinglie
manifeſt.</p>
            <p>3. The perſons, to whom God
would thus manifeſt his counſell,
were the <hi>heires of promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The meanes whereby God
would thus manifeſt his counſell,
was this, That what he promiſed,
he <hi>bound with an oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Theſe two euidences of
Gods counſell, bee ſure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</p>
            <p>6. It is impoſſible that God <hi>ſhould

            <p>11. This Anker which will

            <p>13. Chriſt our <hi>forerunner</hi> is

            <p>Behold what ſtore of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
matters be here contained;
which when I did conſider ſo
cloſelie folded vp, and ſo well
furthering the point in hand, I
was drawne thus to vnfold them.
Among all, this is ſpeciall for our
purpoſe, that Almighty God as
a louing Father hauing prouided
for his children a good eſtate,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29133:120"/>
was very carefull to make it ſure
vnto them, and therefore hath
giuen two ſuch euidences as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceiue, his promiſe and oath;
that wee being perſwaded heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
might in all our feares, for
out refuge, caſt our hope vpon
his fidelitie: ſo ſhall we bee ſafe,
and haue ſtrong conſolation.
Wherein we ſee the ſingular vſe
of this hope of eternall life, <hi>that
it is hope which makes vs not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note>
as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and
the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> exceeding
oft the ſame:<note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Yea, that we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by hope:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> we are ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of our ſaluation, as if wee
poſſeſſed it already; and therefore
<hi>doe with patience waite for it.</hi>
There is much in this Scripture
to this end, that as the whole
<hi>Creation as it were groaneth and
trauelleth in paine, with earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
waiting for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of the ſonnes of God, what
time they ſhall bee deliuered from
the bondage of corruption into the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29133:121"/>
glorious liberty of the children of
God: So all true beleeuers (who
haue the firſt fruites of the ſpirit)
groane in themſelues, waiting for
the Adoption:</hi> to wit, <hi>the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their bodies:</hi> that is, for a
full glorification of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
This is to bee ſeene in the
liues and deaths of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeruants,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>who for this hope,
endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed
ſhame,</hi> as is teſtified of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
himſelfe; and of <hi>Moſes</hi> that
<hi>hee did chooſe rather to ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the people of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>then to
enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
esteeming the reproch of Chriſt
greater riches then the treaſures in
Egypt, for hee had respect to the
recompence of reward.</hi> The ſame is
to be ſeene in all that honourable
company mentioned, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.
And ſo in all the holy Martyrs in
all ages, what was it, but this
hope of glory, after a ſhort ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
which made them willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to endure ſo great and ſore
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29133:121"/>
perſecutions? I might bee long in
this, for the Scripture ſpeakes
much hereof, exhorting vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice
in hope, making it th'end of
our vocation, and regeneration:
<hi>God hath called vs to his kingdome
and glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>God according to his

liuely hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Petr. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>by the reſurrection of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt from the dead, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
incorruptible, vndefiled,
that fadeth not away, reſerued in the

like effect as doth follow, well
worth our reading, and carefull
conſideration, ſeruing much for
the comfort of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Out of all which this is that I
gather,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> ſeeing this hope of glory
is ſo ſure an Anker in all ſtorms,
ſo ſtrong a helmet in all our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
that we therefore careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prouide our ſelues of this
grace: yea rather ſeeing God
hath ſo plentifully prouided it
for vs, and giuen vs ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29133:122"/>
hereof, and hath called vs
hereunto, and ſo oft exhorteth
vs to reioyce in this hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
all this ſhould mooue vs to
hold faſt the profesſion of our
hope without wauering, <hi>For hee
is faithfull that promiſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23</note> as the
Apoſtle exhorteth: otherwiſe we
ſhal call Gods truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
into queſtion, which is a
high degree of tempting God,
and no leſſe prouocation of his
high diſpleaſure: whereas on the
other ſide by caſting this anker
in any ſtorme, wee ſhall bee ſure
to eſcape ſhipwracke, and ſo in
the end arriue at our deſired
port of euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I now ſhewed as
briefly and plainely as I could,
how euery one who is troubled
with vnbeleefe, about the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cainety
of his ſaluation, namely,
whether ſuch as he (ſo void of all
grace, and ſo full of all ſinne) may
be bold to beleeue, and thereby
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29133:122"/>
be aſſured to be ſaued by Chriſt;
and to this end, that his ſinne is
quite forgiuen, and hee accepted
as righteous in Gods ſight, ſo
reconciled to God, and adopted
to be Gods child, that hee may
reioyce in hope of the glory of
God; how ſuch an one (I ſay)
may get and dayly increaſe this
aſſurance of faith, that there is
no <hi>condemnation to him belonging,
but that he hath euerlasting life,
and is paſſed from death to life;</hi> then
which what can be more welcome
and comfortable to a troubled
conſcience, I well ſee not. And
therefore (as oft before) I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
all that feele this weaknes
of faith concerning their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
aboue all to obſerue theſe and
ſuch other Scriptures (whereof
there bee many) wherein Chriſt
and ſaluation be offered to poore
ſinners,<note place="margin">Obſerue Scriptures concerning Chriſt.</note> that they (who haue as
good right to them as any,) may
not for any thing they ſee in
themſelues, put theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29133:123"/>
from them, as not made to
them. But rather in admiration
of Gods wonderfull goodneſſe,
mercy, and compasſion vpon
ſuch vnworthy wretches, to giue
glory to God, in beleeuing and
accepting this mercy ſo freely
offered: which they muſt doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhall ſee ſuch a true
change of heart &amp; life in them, as
they earneſtly deſire, &amp; for want
wherof, they thinke they ought
not to beleeue; which is to ſuch
(if not the onely yet) the chiefeſt
lette and hinderance from faith:
whereas on the other ſide, when
it ſhal pleaſe Gods ſpirit, by theſe
his free promiſes to drawe them
to beleeue, and though weakely,
yet truely to ſtay themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods great mercy ſo reuealed
to them; then aſſuredly ſhall they
ſee and feele this change in their
hearts, that they know not what
to ſay or thinke of Gods mercy,
in pardoning ſuch as they feele
themſelues to be. This cannot
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29133:123"/>
but breede an vnfained loue in
them to God, with an earneſt
deſire and true purpoſe to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him; which be the chiefe parts
of a holy life, and ſureſt proofes
of ſauing faith: which can no
more want theſe, then a true fire
can be without heate (though
too many carnal Goſpellers think
otherwiſe, and ſo miſerably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſeene how wee
are by Gods promiſes to get and
increaſe our aſſurance by faith,
that we be Gods children: Now
it followes, that wee conſider
what be the markes of God chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Aſſurance by the fruits of faith.</note>
whereby we may be further
aſſured thereof. Among which
markes, ſeeing faith it ſelfe is the
firſt and ſureſt proofe that we be
Gods children, and to this end,
many pretious promiſes bee
made to ſuch as doe already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue;
as the former promiſes
were made to beget and increaſe
faith. It is meete that wee take
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29133:124"/>
ſome view of theſe, not for the
ſtrengthening of our faith, but
that by our faith (bee it ſmall or
great) we may haue a ſenſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of our ſaluation. To
which purpoſe may this ſerue,
that we who beleeue in Chriſt,
are ſo oft ſaid to bee bleſſed, as

whereby we may certenly know
that we be Gods children, heires
of ſaluation, and cannot periſh.
We are now further to ſee ſome
ſpeciall fruits of our faith, which
be the effects of Gods Spirit in al
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29133:125"/>
true beleeuers, &amp; be ſo many marks
whereby they doe know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and be knowne to others,
that they be Gods ſheep, &amp; ſo be
further euidences and aſſurances,
that they be Gods children, and
ſhall be ſaued.</p>
            <p>In which reſpect,<note place="margin">Aſſurance by the fruites of faith.</note> this gift of
Gods Spirit to beleeuers is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a ſeale, Epheſians,</hi> 1. 13. Where
the Apoſtle ſetting out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. by the gift of the ſpirit.</note> layes
downe both theſe euidences: firſt
of their faith, ſecondly, of this
gift of the ſpirit: ſaying, <hi>In who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye
alſo (haue obtained inheritance) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ye heard the word of truth,
the Goſpell of your ſaluation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alſo after yee beleeued, yee were
ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe,
which is the earneſt of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
vntill the redemption of the
purchaſed poſſeſſion, vnto the praiſe
of his glory.</hi> In which wee ſee
the Lord deales with vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto the manner of
men; who in their conueyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29133:126"/>
of land doe not onely giue
writings to make known their
grants, but to make them ſure,
doe ſet ſeales to their writings,
and beſides do giue a turfe of the
land to aſſure the poſſesſion: ſo
the Lord hauing giuen vs his
word and writing for ſaluation
in Chriſt, thereby to make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
doth alſo giue his Spirit ſo
manifeſtly to worke in them,
that they bee thereby more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that Chriſt is theirs, and
that by him they ſhall inherite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
glory. For which cauſe, it
is ſaid, they were ſealed with the
Spirit of promiſe (that is, which
was promiſed to all beleeuers.)
And this gift of the Spirit, is ſaid
to be as an earneſt penny, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vs we ſhall enioy the full bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or rather the whole gift of
perfect happines in Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Of this I vnderſtand that
of the Apoſtle, where hee ſaith,
that though ſome who had made
a faire profesſion, were now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29133:126"/>
away from the faith,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
the foundation of God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſure, hauing this ſeale, the Lord
knoweth them that are his; and let
euery one that nameth the name of
Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> Where
hee makes the foundation of our
ſaluation to bee Gods election;
and a ſeale or ſtampe whereby
we be knowne to be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to bee an holy life, a part
whereof is departing from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Thus then wee may ſee in
generall, that the gift of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit, which is the firſt
and chiefeſt fruit of faith, and
roote of other graces neceſſary
to ſaluation, is a moſt ſure eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that we bee the children
of God, and heires of ſaluation
by Chriſt; which might ſuffiſe to
aſſure any man of his ſtate to bee
very good, if he be not deceiued,
but be ſure he hath receiued this
ſanctifying Spirit: for ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 13. reaſoneth,
<hi>Hereby we know that wee dwell in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29133:127"/>
him, and he in vs, becauſe hee hath
giuen vs of his ſpirit:</hi> as was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpoken in the former part of
this Treatiſe, and is now for our
better aſſurance that we bee in
Gods fauour, more largely to be
laid open, if not in all, yet in the
moſt principall effects of this
Spirit dwelling it vs.</p>
            <p>Among which,<note place="margin">Aſſurance of ſaluation by keeping Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> good order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
to begin with that which
is moſt generall, and containes
the reſt: namely, the keeping of
Gods commandements, which in
ſundry places is made a ſure mark
of ſauing grace. This is manifeſt
in that diuine Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
which was written principally to
this end, to ſet downe ſundry
marks wherby it may be known,
who be the true children of God,
and who not. Among which this
is one, the keeping of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemencs,
as 1. epiſt. chap. 2.
verſ. 3. <hi>And hereby we know that
we know him, if wee keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:</hi>
the meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29133:127"/>
is, that the conſcionable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to frame our liues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods will reuealed in his
word, is a moſt certen mark, that
we be true beleeuers, and ſo the
true children of God &amp; heires of
glory. To this end is that ch. 3. 22.
where he makes this keeping of
Gods commaundements an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
note that wee are in Gods
fauour: ſo that, <hi>Whatſoeuer wee
aske, we receiue of him.</hi> And again,
verſ. 24 He that <hi>keepeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
dwelleth in him, and
he in him.</hi> It would be too long,
and I thinke needeleſſe to heape
vp more of this argument: for
the Scriptures are full of theſe
promiſes made to the righteous,
to obedience, to ſuch as walke
in <hi>Gods way, hearken to his voyce,
beare much fruites, bee new
creatures,</hi> and many of like ſort.
All meaning the ſame thing, to
leade a godly life, which whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doth in truth, though with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29133:128"/>
much weakeneſſe, hee may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
thereby aſſure himſelfe of
his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Which if many a poore ſoule
(who haue a good care to pleaſe
God, and that of very loue vnto
him for his mercy) would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it might comfort them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all their feares and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
riſing from the ſenſe of their
infirmities, which for iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
God doth leaue in his deare
children. And therefore (theſe
being the perſons for whoſe ſake
ſpecially I write theſe,) I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beſeech them to deale righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with God, and their owne
ſoules, and not to robbe God of
his honour, and themſelues of
their comfort in doubting of his
fauour, but rather acknowledge
the gracious worke of God, in ſo
renewing them by his Spirit, that
whereas by nature they had no
care to pleaſe God, nor conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of obedience: Now God
and their owne conſciences doe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29133:128"/>
witneſſe, and Gods people doe
ſee, it is their chiefeſt endeauour
to pleaſe God in all things, and
their greateſt griefe to offend
him: whereupon they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
conclude, That they are
in the ſtate of grace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the burthen of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
vnder which they grone
and oft deſire to be diſſolued, and
to be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes, this might abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſuffiſe, to confirme anie
truely conuerted ſoules, that their
caſe is good, and their end ſhall
be ſafe, notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſore battailes and blowes they
meete with all by their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet dwelling nor reigning in
them.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord (who of
old ſaw how hard it would bee
for vs,<note place="margin">Particular duties.</note> to hold faſt this aſſurance
of our ſafety, eſpecially when
our enemies ſeeme to haue the
vpper hand,) hath made ſo many
promiſes of ſaluation, not onely
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29133:129"/>
to generall obedience, but almoſt
to all particulars, that though we
many times, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fetch comfort
from ſome duties &amp; fruits of our
faith, yet we may from others, &amp;
neuer want ſome true euidences
of our faith and happines. It ſhall
be expedient to ſet downe ſome
chiefe, referring the diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Scriptures, to take a
patterne by theſe to obſerue and
make vſe of the reſt as he can.</p>
            <p>Among all,<note place="margin">1. Loue a marke of happineſſe.</note> the firſt and chiefe
fruite of Faith is loue to God,
and all them which belong to
him, to Chriſt and to all his
members; all which be vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ioyned, and doe all proceed
from the loue of God to vs, as
1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 19. Wee loue him, becauſe
he loued vs firſt.</hi> From whence
we may ſoundly gather, that as
Gods loue is the cauſe of our
loue of him; ſo our loue of God
is a certaine proofe that wee are
loued of God, and ſhall be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
bleſſed and ſaued by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:29133:129"/>
him; which the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi>
expreſſeth,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 12. 25.</note> 
               <hi>That God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the crowne of Life,</hi> (and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place) <hi>The kingdome to
them that loue him.</hi> The ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is intended in that heauenly
ſaying of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>And wee
know that all things worke together
for good to them that loue God, to
them that are the called according
to his purpoſe.</hi> And the ſame
may be gathered out of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſentence,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9. &amp; 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Eye hath not
ſeene nor eare heard, neither hath
entered into the heart of man, the
things which God hath prepared
for them that loue him;</hi> And to
like effect, <hi>But if any man loue
God, the ſame is knowne of him.</hi>
In all which and the like many,
our loue of God is made a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
proofe that we be in Gods
fauour, and heires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:<note place="margin">Our loue to Chriſt.</note>
ſo likewiſe is our loue to
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 21. 23.</note> as he himſelfe profeſſeth,
<hi>And he that loueth me ſhall bee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of my Father</hi> (where our
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29133:130"/>
loue of Chriſt is not the cauſe,
but the effect of Gods loue to
vs, as followeth a little after: <hi>If
any man loue me hee will keepe my
words, and my Father will loue
him, and we will come vnto him,
and make our abode with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like ſort our loue we beare
one to another as brethren and
members of the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Loue of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note>
is made an infallible marke, that
we belong to Chriſt, as he ſaid to
his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 35.</note> 
               <hi>By this ſhall all men
know that yee are my Diſciples if
you loue one another.</hi> And for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofe hereof we need goe
no further, then to the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>John,</hi> in which this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue is oft ſet downe, as
a ſure euidence, that we are in a

               <hi>Hee that loueth his

               <note place="margin">chap. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and
there is no occaſion of ſtumbling in

are paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we loue the Brethren.</hi> And in

               <hi>If wee loue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29133:130"/>
God dwelleth in vs, and his
loue is perfected in vs.</hi> And a little
before in the ſame chapter,<note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
let vs loue one another; for loue
is of God, and euery one that loueth is
borne of God.</hi> And againe verſe
17. <hi>Herein is our loue made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that we haue boldneſſe in the
day of Iudgement.</hi> Yea more, our
Sauiour teacheth,<note place="margin">Loue of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> that the loue of
our enemies is a good proofe
that we are the children of God,
as both the Euangeliſt <hi>Mathew</hi>
and <hi>Luke</hi> report.<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 44, 45.</note> The places be
knowne.<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>From all which wee ſee how
any (who calleth in queſtion,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
whether hee hath true faith, and
be in the ſtate of grace) may by
this grace of loue aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that he hath true faith, and
ſo ſhall bee ſaued. Onely we muſt
take heed wee deceaue not our
ſelues with a vaine carnall loue,<note place="margin">Take heed of deceit.</note>
(as many doe) which ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by theſe two eſpecially,
whether our loue come from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29133:131"/>
Faith, and ſecondly breed true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
which if it doe, it is
ſound, and a ſure warrant of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
grace: otherwiſe if either
of theſe bee wanting, then our
loue at beſt is but naturall, which
can be no proofe of true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For further manifeſtation
hereof that our loue is ſound,
and ſo our faith, and ſafety, we
need no other arguments then
to ſee what bee the fruites that
grow from hence. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in ſundrie places make loue
the root of all fruites of a godly
life,<note place="margin">Rome. 13. 10</note> calling it the <hi>fulfilling of the
Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and the bond of perfectneſſe,</hi>
So that if our loue be fruitfull in
holineſſe to God, and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
to men, it will manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare that wee bee the true
children of God.</p>
            <p>Herein may well come in the
firſt place,<note place="margin">2. Feare of God.</note> 
               <hi>the feare of God,</hi> which
if it come not from loue, and be
not tempered therewith, is but
a ſeruile feare, and not that holy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29133:131"/>
feare which is made ſuch a
marke of Gods children, that it
is vſually made a ſurname to
them all, to be ſuch as feare God:
As,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112. 1. 115. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth
the Lord, and greatly delighteth in
his Commandements; Hee will
bleſſe them that feare the Lord
both ſmall and great.</hi> And the like
many. That which wee are here
chiefly to regard, is, what high
commendations are giuen to
this fruite of Faith, the feare of
God, whereby he that feeles this
grace, may know he is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
and ſhall bee ſaued. This
is to bee ſeene in all thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
where they that feare the
Lord be pronounced bleſſed, as
in the laſt forenamed places, and
ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 1. 4. meaning, hee
that feares the Lord, is and ſhall
be euery way bleſſed. To the
ſame purpoſe be thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which ſet out the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and perpetuity of Gods
mercy to thoſe that feare him,

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 11. 17. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 50.
the places bee knowne. Such is
that,<note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 19</note> 
               <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe
which thou haſt laid vp for them
that feare thee!</hi> The like, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 12
It would bee long to cite all of
this kinde. Theſe bee ſome, that
ſuch as feare God are accepted
of him,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 26</note> 
               <hi>That God will teach the
man that feareth him in the way
that he ſhall chooſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 12 &amp; 347, 10</note> and more in

of righteouſneſſe ſhall riſe vp to
theſe, and the reward of eternall
life ſhall be giuen them,</hi> Reu. 11.
18. If this bee not ſufficient, I
know not what may be, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
any man who findeth this
true feare of God in his heart,
that he is and ſhall be bleſſed for
euer.</p>
            <p>It behoueth therefore all that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29133:132"/>
would haue this comfort, to
make ſure to themſelues, that
God hath put this holy feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hearts, and ſo may they
reſt aſſured of Gods loue.</p>
            <p>Thus would I leaue this point,
but I feare ſome tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
will aske, how may I know
that I haue this holy feare in me;
whom I might ſend to that briefe
note of difference that I gaue a
little before, which in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the beſt difference between
the good feare and the bad;
namely the holy and childe-like
feare, comes from the loue of
God, the other at the beſt from
ſelfe-loue; which may goe farre,
yet can it neuer come neere the
holy feare, as not in the roote of
Faith and Loue, ſo neither in the
fruit of ſyncere obedience, which
the Holy Ghoſt makes the fruite
of the feare of God,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Feare God
and keepe his Commandements.</hi>
He then that feeles Gods rich
mercie vnto him, in calling him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29133:133"/>
out of his miſerable eſtate, to
ſome hope of ſaluation by
Chriſt) to breed in him a loue to
God for the ſame, and that loue
to make him afraid to diſpleaſe
and offend ſo gracious a Father;
and ſhall finde this feare mouing
him to ſhun what God diſlikes,
though neuer ſo pleaſing to his
corrupt nature, and to make him
willing to doe Gods will, though
againſt his corrupt will: this
man need not doubt, but that he
hath the true feare of God,
which is ſo certaine a marke of
Gods fauour, and of euerlaſting
happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And this is the vſe Gods
children are to make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
Thus we ſee how the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
may by theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fruites of their faith, loue
and feare, bee confirmed in the
aſſurance of their ſaluation by
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſhewed in all
the reſt, which the Scripture
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29133:133"/>
makes to be ſo many teſtimonies
of ſauing grace and happineſſe
to thoſe that haue them: As
<hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>they
that mourne, the humble, meeke,
ſuch as hunger after righteouſneſſe,
mercifull, pure in heart, peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
perſecuted for righteouſneſſe
ſake.</hi> All which are in this place
gathered together by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt, to croſſe the corrupt
opinion of the world, and to
ſhew that they whom the world
account aboue all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
are indeed truly and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happy.</p>
            <p>The like hee doth in other
places,<note place="margin">Mat. 16 28 19. 29.</note> where hee maketh <hi>the
denying of our ſelues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 30.</note> 
               <hi>taking vp
the Croſſe and following him,
forſaking all for him, and
for the Goſpell, to bee ſure
tokens to bee his, who ſhall haue
an hundred-fold in this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note>
               <hi>and in the world to come life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting.</hi>
To end this whole
matter of aſſurance of ſaluation,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29133:134"/>
and to paſſe ouer many other
fruites of Faith which doe proue
the ſame, as the confeſsion of
ſinne, mortification thereof,
ouercomming, and Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
All which bee oft made
certaine proofes of happineſſe.
This is the maine vſe which is to
bee made of all theſe,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> (as hath
oft been ſaid) that when (as it oft
falleth out with Gods children,
eſpecially ſuch as haue weake
faith and tender conſciences)
that they beholding their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſinne, and deadneſſe of
ſpirit to all holy duties, doe fall
into great feares and doubts of
their ſaluation, this may be ſome
ſtaie vnto them, that they may
ſee ſome of theſe fruites of their
faith in them, euen when they be
at the loweſt ebbe of grace, by
which they may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
that though they bee very
ſicke and weake, yet they be not
ſtarke dead. For whoſe ſakes I
will adde this obſeruation by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29133:134"/>
mine owne experience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I haue quieted the mindes
of many much perplexed in this
caſe,<note place="margin">Markes of faith which is not ſeene</note> for that they could not ſee
they had any faith, that there is a
true liuing faith in many, who
haue no feeling thereof.</p>
            <p>I haue obſerued theſe foure
vnfallible proofes.<note place="margin">1. Vnquiet for want of faith.</note> Firſt where
Faith is, and not felt, the partie
in whom it is, &amp; cannot ſee that
he hath any Faith, is grieued for
want of Faith, and cannot bee
quiet for want of it, but mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
as if hee had none; which
for the moſt part is the ſtate of
thoſe that bee truely afflicted in
conſcience, who faine would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
but yet in their owne ſenſe
doe not: And yet in my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
I neuer knew any ſuch (who
had any knowledge of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Faith) but indeed they
had ſome Faith, though they ſaw
it not.<note place="margin">2. Spare no meanes to get foitfi.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This will more appeare by the
next effect of this inſenſible faith,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:29133:135"/>
which is this; that they who haue
Faith and yet feele it not, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
painefull in vſe of all good
meanes, both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
by themſelues and with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
wherby they might hope
to get this pretious gift of Faith;
which hardly would any doe if
hee had not ſome taſte of the
ſweetneſſe of Faith though hee
feele it not, which ſo ſtirres vp
his heart to ſeeke after it: and
therefore I hold this conſtant
ſeeking of Faith, to be a token of
ſome to be in him alreadie.</p>
            <p>A third and more principall
effect of Faith in theſe,<note place="margin">3. Carrie a good heart to God.</note> is this,
that though they ſee not Gods
Fatherly loue to them, yet they
cannot thinke hardly of God, but
lay all the fault on themſelues,
why they haue no more grace;
yea, they will commend Gods
mercie to others, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any diſhonour to God:
which great loue of theirs to
God, doth ſhew they are loued
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:29133:135"/>
of him, yea that they haue by
Faith apprehended it, though
they ſee it not, and feare they
haue it not.</p>
            <p>The fourth proofe of Faith,<note place="margin">4. A good conſcience.</note>
where it is not ſeene, may be this
that ſuch haue a tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſhunning ſmall ſinnes, which
others dare boldly doe; and bee
carefull to pleaſe God in euery
thing, which many who be not
ſo diſquieted be more careleſſe of.
So then if there bee any poore
ſoules who cannot ſee their
faith, yet if they can ſee any of
theſe effects of Faith in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
let them know for a truth,
and to their comfort, that they
haue true Faith &amp; ſhall be ſaued.</p>
            <p>And thus haue I ſaid what I
thinke meet for this firſt point,
how we may daily get more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
that we be now in Gods
fauour, and ſhall want no good
thing in this life, and ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in the end come to life
euerlaſting. Which I againe doe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29133:136"/>
exhort euery one (who lookes
for any bleſsing from God either
in this life, or that to come) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all to labour for, ſeeing
without this aſſurance that wee
be in Gods fauour, how can wee
looke for any bleſsing from God
earthly or ſpirituall, temporall or
eternall? whereas being aſſured
hereof, we may boldly looke for
all other bleſsings needfull for
our preſent comfort and eternall
happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Concerning all which, ſeeing
the Lord (who did well know
the frailtie of his owne children,<note place="margin">All other bleſſings depend on this.</note>
how readie they are vpon euery
occaſion to doubt of his helpe)
hath ſo plentifully recorded in
the Scriptures both generally,
what a fatherly care hee hath of
their welfare, and alſo more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
what helpe they may look
for from him, in their particular
neceſsities: I doe not doubt but
it will bee worth our labour, to
conſider of them both; and all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29133:136"/>
little enough to comfort vs in
our greateſt need. And firſt of
the generall, which containe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them all good things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
God hath prepared and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to all his children. Of this
ſort may that come firſt, which
is the ground of all the reſt,
namely that <hi>God will bee our God
and of our ſeed after vs,</hi> as hee
ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of
the faithfull,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> and ſo belongeth to
all beleeuers, as the Apoſtle
ſhewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. 16. which ſelfe
ſame promiſe, was after repeated
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity in al ages,
to be a ſtaffe of comfort to them
at all times; therefore is it oft
ſaid, <hi>That God is the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
the God of Iſaac, the God
of Iacob.</hi> Likewiſe God ſaid to
the people of Iſrael, And <hi>I will
take you to me to bee a people, and
I will be to you a God.</hi> And moſt
notable is that when the Lord
gaue his Law to his people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,
that he bound his people to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29133:137"/>
obedience by theſe two bonds of
his great Maieſtie, and his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
fauour ſaying,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 6. and 6. 7. and 20. 2.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord
thy God.</hi> It would be tedious and
needleſſe to heape more of this
ſort; for this was promiſed to
the faithful, by the Prophets and
Apoſtles in all ages, that God
would be their God, and they
ſhould be his people: Whereby
was meant that they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
receaue from him whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
might bee good for them;
and ſhould yeeld to him all that
obedience which he required. In
which one promiſe if wee could
ſtedfaſtly beleeue, and reſt vpon,
we ſhould finde more true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
then in all the world beſide.
And therefore I deſire all that
want comfort, to thinke much
vpon this. Of this kinde likewiſe
be all thoſe gracious promiſes,
that <hi>God is our portion,</hi> that is,
all wee haue to maintaine vs in
this world; and wee his <hi>portion,</hi>
that is, the chiefeſt thing hee
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29133:137"/>
makes reckoning of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 5. 19. 5. 1. 7. 142. 5.</note>

               <hi>his choſen, his delight,</hi>

in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 26.</note> all ſhewing how
deare vnto God his people are,<note place="margin">Pſal. 135. 4.</note>
that they may aſſure themſelues
they ſhall not want,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 5.</note> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid</hi> concluded vpon that
meditation that the <hi>Lord was
his ſheepheard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 1. and 146. 9.</note> To this end is
God ſaid to bee <hi>Father to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe,
a helper to the widow,</hi>
to ſuccour them, &amp; to ſupplie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with all needfull bleſsings, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and bodily. To this purpoſe
very comfortable is that, <hi>Pſal.
84, 11. For the Lord God is a
Sun and Shield, the Lord will giue
grace and glory, and no good thing
will hee with-hold from them that
walke vprightly:</hi> Meaning that
the Sunne is not more benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the earth then God to his.</p>
            <p>Oh that we had hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and beleeue theſe! Then
might we ſay and ſing for ioy of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29133:138"/>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is

I bee afraid?</hi> And to like effect,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 7. 8. Seeing the Lord
hath thought it needfull ſo oft to
teſtifie his goodneſſe vnto vs,
there is no reaſon wee ſhould
thinke much to remember the
ſame for our good. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid</hi> was neuer wearie of
thinking hereof, which was (as I
conceaue) that which made him
ſo large-hearted towards God,
and ſo excelling others in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conuerſation, as himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth

the like effects of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and prouident care ouer
his, to miniſter vnto them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
releefe in all their needs, are
throughout the Scriptures ſo oft
repeated, that in what condition
ſoeuer wee bee, wee might haue
ſtore of helpe at hand, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our faith, that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

wee ſhall aſſuredly finde all

for this life and that to come.
I doe therefore commend vnto
all thoſe who haue ſo profited by
the former promiſes pertaining
to the aſſurance of ſaluation, that
they haue ſome comfort therein,
this care, to obſerue well theſe
large legacies which the Lord
both in the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath bequeathed to all his
children, as ſo many priuiledges
belonging to them, whereof no
other perſon in the world
(though neuer ſo high in mans
account) ſhall euer bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
That they be not diſmaid
with any diſcouragements, they
ſhall meet with, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
and glory in their happie
condition, and ſo bee carefull to
walke worthy of the ſame, that
they may thereby honour God
their Father, and that high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
whereto hee hath aduanced
them; yea, alſo mooue many to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:29133:139"/>
ſeeke to be partakers with them,
of ſo bleſſed a condition. I could
heere willingly take vp a bitter
complaint againſt many of good
hope, that ſpend moſt of their
daies either ſecurely, or vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably,<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 10.</note>
not finding this ioy of
the Lord to be their ſtrength, and
not walking in the light of Gods
fauour, ſo cheerefully as they
might, if they would better
weigh theſe gracious promiſes
made vnto them: and ſo lay
hold vpon them as their owne,
whereby they might be refreſhed
in their greateſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But this being beſides my
intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I wil thus end this point</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The ſecond generall Head.</head>
               <p>Now wee come to the ſecond
generall matter wherein we are
to liue by faith, namely, how we
may be able to mortifie our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature, and ouercome our
ſpeciall ſinnes, which moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
ouer vs. That this cannot
be without faith, hath beene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:29133:140"/>
prooued, in the former
part of this Treatiſe; and how
this power is obtained by faith
from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Heere onely wee are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what promiſes God hath
made vnto vs in the Scriptures, to
ſtrengthen our faith in this, that
whereas we are full of doubting,
how we (who are ſo full of ſinne,
yea naturally ſold vnder ſinne,
and oft held captiue vnder ſome
ſtrong corruptions) ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ouercome theſe: yet wee
may heare ſuch comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
from God, as may aſſure
vs, no ſinne ſhall haue dominion
ouer vs: but we ſhall daily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
it, and in the end obtaine a
full victory ouer it. For which
purpoſe I cannot begin with any
Scripture more effectuall then
this ſelfe ſame,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1. &amp;c.</note> where the Apoſtle
doth not onely ſhew the abſolute
neceſsitie of forſaking ſinne, by
all thoſe who bee members of
Chriſt: but thereupon he exhorts
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:29133:140"/>
them all, ſaying: <hi>Let not ſinne
reigne in your mortall body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that yee
ſhould obey it in the luſt thereof;</hi> and
ſhewes the way how this may be
attained, by not yeelding vnto
ſinne their mindes and hearts
(which be principall <hi>members</hi> of
the old man, and <hi>weapons</hi> of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe)
but rather <hi>yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themſelues vnto God, as thoſe
that are aliue from the dead, and
their members as inſtruments of
righteouſneſſe vnto God.</hi> And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this might iuſtly bee obiected,
Alaſſe: how ſhall wee (who
by nature are ſo vnable to
reſiſt ſo mighty a Tyrant as ſin
is, who hath ouercome all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
Chriſt onely excepted)
euer be able ſo to withſtand ſin?
For anſwer whereto, the Apoſtle
brings a moſt comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
vnto all that <hi>be not vnder the
Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 14.</note> 
                  <hi>but vnder grace</hi> (that is, who

whereby it reignes ouer all vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:29133:141"/>
but by true receiuing of
Chriſt by faith are now deliuered
from that bondage, &amp; ſo brought
into the liberty of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
which he ſaith, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>grace</hi> (whereof the Apoſtle
ſpeaks more fully, <hi>Rom. 6. 1.)</hi> Of
theſe he ſaith, <hi>That ſinne ſhall not
haue dominion ouer them,</hi> meaning
that although theſe doe ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſinne, (that is, corruption of
nature) which continually fights
againſt the grace of God in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yet the corruption and ſinnefull
nature, ſhall neuer any more
reigne as in times paſt it did, and
ſo haue the full victory ouer
them. But they by the grace of
Gods Spirit reigning in them,
ſhall daily more and more ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
this their ſinnefull nature,
and in the end get a glorious
conqueſt ouer it, and all other
their ſpirituall enemies.</p>
               <p>This one Scripture, if there
were no more, is ſufficient, if it be
truelie weighed and beleeued,
to comfort euery childe of God
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29133:141"/>
ouer all his ſinnes; that though
they bee neuer ſo many, or neuer
ſo great, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet being here aſſured the
roote of ſinne ſhall be killed,<note place="margin">ver. 18. 22.</note> hee
may then quietly reſt his ſoule
in peace, that all the fruits and
branches ſhall in time quite
wither; for certainety where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this is twiſe repeated.</p>
               <p>But the Lord knowing how
hardly we be brought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
hereof, (eſpecially when
we be vnder captiuity of any ſin,
as of vnbeliefe, pride, anger
worldlineſſe, and the like) hath
much laboured in his word to
comfort vs herein: that though
the battell be ſore, and our
ſtrength ſmall, yet <hi>his grace ſhall
bee ſufficient for vs, and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7 8, 9.</note>
as was ſaid to <hi>Paul</hi> in his

by the aboundance of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
which though ſpoken to

poore ſoule, who feeles his ſinne
too hard for him, that when he

with him; hee is to lay holde on
this promiſe, that Gods grace
ſhall bee ſufficient for him, and
Gods ſtrength ſhall bee made
perfect in his weakeneſſe: That
ſo complaining with the Apoſtle,

which if wee could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
would put more ſpirit into

among the reſt mention our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification

the ſelfe ſame ſpirit (though in

that Chriſt is the lambe
of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>which taketh away the

wee enioy by Chriſt is, that
we who bee members of him are
cleanſed, as from the guiltineſſe

ſo from the filthineſſe of

                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 25.</note> Eſai <hi>oft, that</hi> God will

                  <hi>Againe,</hi> By this therefore ſhall

<hi>Of this ſort I might gather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               </p>
               <p>It ſhall bee more to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
well to weigh theſe and the

ſtrength wee finde to maiſter our
ſpeciall corruptions, then we
may apply to our ſelues any one
of theſe promiſes, wherein the
Lord himſelfe doth vndertake
this worke which is too hard for
vs; <hi>That hee will ſubdue our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he will cleanſe vs from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,

<hi>to ſerue the liuing God,</hi> as is

               <p>Let not any therfore who fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

ſay in his heart, I ſhall
neuer ouercome ſuch and ſuch
ſinnes, but ſhall one day periſh
by theſe: for this were not onely
to miſtruſt his owne ſtrength,
(which well he may) but to call
Gods power, goodnes, and truth
into queſtion: which were a great
iniury to God and to his owne
ſoule: but rather let vs all doe as
<hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when hee ſawe a great
army gathered together againſt
him,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 20 12.</note> ſo as hee ſawe no power in
himſelfe to withſtand them, hee
did wholly caſt himſelfe vpon the
Lord, ſaying, <hi>O our God, wilt thou

and vſing the holy armour of his

be ſure of the victory.</p>
               <p>Theſe thus being, that Gods
children may be ſo certaine, that
no ſinne ſhall haue dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them, but that they ſhall in
the end ouercome them all, and
ſo haue that glorious conqueſt
ouer them, and ouer all their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
enemies (who can no way
hurt them but by ſinne:) how can
it ſufficiently be bewailed, that ſo
few do enioy this benefit, and the
ſweet comfort thereof?</p>
               <p>This may well bee ſeeee in the
many and foule ſpots in the faces
of ſundry profeſſours; I meane
their open pride, their impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
their worldlineſſe, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:29133:147"/>
of ſpirit in all ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
all which, though they
might (in ſome of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſtanding
in Chriſt) haue been long before
well mortified, yet they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
liue, and grow in them,
to their reproch before others,
and ſmall peace and comfort to
their owne hearts. A principall
cauſe hereof muſt needs be this,
that theſe pleaſing themſelues in
their eſtate, for that they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in publike exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(though many bee ſlacke
enough in priuate, eſpecially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
by themſelues alone,) and
for that they bee free from the
groſſe ſinnes of the wicked, doe
either not ſee or not bewaile
theſe their ſinnes, and therefore
doe not ſo much as ſeeke after,
much leſſe enioy theſe pretious
promiſes: and the fruit of them.
An other ſort (who are more to
be pitied for their want of this
comfort which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, and ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:29133:147"/>

bee they who groane vnder

yet in long time finding ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
be much diſcouraged
with feare, that they ſhall neuer
be able to ouercome theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
which doe moſt annoy
them. I cannot thinke of any
thing to bee a greater cauſe of
this diſcouragement in theſe,
then either the ignorance, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe,
or not beleeuing
theſe promiſes,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> that <hi>Hee who hath

               <p>It remaineth therefore, that

theſe promiſes, and ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that <hi>he is faithfull who hath
promiſed,</hi> confidently looke for

               <p>This I hope may ſuffiſe in this
point, to quiet the minds of all

how they ſhall be able to get the

               <p>If any ſhould further require,
to haue particular promiſes for
particular ſinnes, hee is to know
that howſoeuer the Lord doth
ſometimes deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25, 26.</note>
as that the <hi>wil cleanſe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the ſtony heart out of them,</hi> and
ſuch like:</p>
               <p>Yet this is not done in euery
ſin, neither is it needfull; for when
God ſpeaketh ſo generally, that
he will clenſe vs from all vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
and that he will heale al

more? Let vs then learne to apply
theſe generall promiſes to our

doubt but it will as ſufficiently
comfort vs, as if the Lord had

               <p>Onely let vs be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

            <p>All which as we ſee be euident

all our righteouſneſſe, is as a ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Gods pure eyes cannot endure;
of necesſity it follows, that they

of the ſatisfaction made by

            </p>
            <p>Wherein wee haue theſe two
ſpeciall branches to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
How we may get this grace,
to leade a godly life, or how wee
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29133:153"/>
may haue comfort that this ſhall
be accepted.</p>
            <p>For the former,<note place="margin">Some chiefe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement.</note> that wee may
better ſee how vnable wee bee of
our ſelues to performe all holy
obedience, and ſo bee more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to embrace the remedy: I
deſire euery one carefully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
himſelfe by the Lawe of
God, how exceedingly he faileth
in euery one of them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As for example, in the firſt
commandement:</hi> In not walking
with God, not reſting vpon him
for relief in all his necesſities, nor
ſo delighting in him, as to count
nothing too deare for him, and
that he is not more afraid to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
God, then any in the world
beſides.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
how ſlacke and ſlight hee is
in all the worſhip of God, both
priuate and publike: as namely, in
priuate praier (which yet for the
moſt part is in greateſt vſe.) As
for reading the ſcriptures, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29133:153"/>
godly bookes, how ſeldome?
meditation alone, and conference
with others, how little thought
vpon? So likewiſe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
what careleſſe and vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearing, praying, ſinging and
receiuing of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In the third commandement.</hi>
How backeward he is lifting vp
the name of God, ſo as he might
by all his behauiour, bring God
into better eſteeme with thoſe
with whom he conuerſeth.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>In the fourth commandement.</hi>
What adoe he hath to keepe his
whole man imployed about the
true ſanctification of the Lords
Sabbath.</p>
            <p>In all which whoſoeuer ſhall
conſcionably conſider his waies,
I nothing doubt but he ſhall ſee
iuſt cauſe to complaine of his
want of faith, whereby alone hee
ſhould receiue power from
Chriſt and his Spirit, much more
effectually to performe all theſe
holy duties to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:29133:154"/>
The like defect ſhall be found
vpon due examination in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of righteouſneſſe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
table, which God requireth
both in regard of our ſelues and
our neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As in the fifth commandement.</hi>
I wiſh euery one duely to waigh
how badly hee diſchargeth the
dutie of his ſpeciall place, either
in the Family, Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
both ſuch as are ſet
aboue others, and ſuch as be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
gouernours and gouerned:
and then he ſhall well ſee what
neede he hath of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to enable
him to a better performance of
thoſe duties, which his place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>In the ſixt commandement.</hi>
How careleſſe he is both in auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thoſe things which hurt the
life and health of body and ſoule,
both of himſelfe and others: and
in vſing all good meanes for the
preſeruation of both; And much
more wanting in bearing and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29133:154"/>
forgiuing wrongs, in louing his
enemies, and ouercomming euill
with goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>In the ſeauenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
likewiſe.</hi> What little watch
and meanes are vſed to keepe
both ſoule and body chaſte: and
ſo to auoide all allurements to
vncleanneſſe, ſoberly vſing all
our ſenſes, and their delights.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>In the eight commandement.</hi>
How hee failes in getting his
goods iuſtly, and ſo vſing them
holily to Gods honour, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the releefe of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and wiſely to his owne
good, of ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>In the ninth commandement.</hi>
How careleſſe he is as to auoide
all blemiſhing of his owne good
name, or his neighbours any
manner of way, and ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
either, and to recouer them
being wounded, by ſuch meanes
as God hath appointed.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>In the tenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
How hardly he can bring
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29133:155"/>
his heart to loue his neighbour
as himſelfe, and to be as loath to
hurt him as his owne ſelfe, and
to ſeeke his neighbours good as
his owne.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I briefely drawne
out of the Commandements,
ſome of the chiefeſt duties; which
we cannot deny, but that as wee
are bound to performe them, and
deſire ſo to doe, ſo we faile much
in the practiſe of them: neither
poſsibly can we doe better, till
we receiue grace from Chriſt to
enable vs thereunto.</p>
            <p>Theſe being ſo manifeſt, I
hope I ſhall not neede to ſay any
thing more, to perſwade any true
Chriſtian to labour for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of this pretious gift of
faith, whereby he may get power
from Chriſt, better to obey God
in all that he ſhall require at his
hands.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would now
ſet vpon this worke (which is my
chiefe intent) to gather ſome
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:29133:155"/>
ſpeciall promiſes, and to ſhew the
right vſe of Faith, for our helpe
in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>But that I remember there is
an other branch of this matter,<note place="margin">2. Branch of this third point, how our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note>
namely, how we may doe all our
workes in faith, that God will
accept thereof. Wherein it will
be no hard matter to ſhew that
we are for the moſt part as much
(if not more) failing, then in the
former; as both reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will prooue. For a
meere naturall man voide of all
ſauing grace, may be drawne by
ſelfe-loue for his owne good, or
by feare of danger that might
befall him, to doe many good
things,<note place="margin">Mark. 6. 20.</note> as wee reade of <hi>Herod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 10. 30.</note>
               <hi>Iehu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Amaziah, who did that
which was right in the ſight of the
Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to bee perſwaded vpon
good ground, that God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our weake and ſinfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
for perfect, as if it were
without fault, this requires true
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:29133:156"/>
grace, yea a greater meaſure
then many a weake beleeuer can
attaine.</p>
            <p>From hence it ſpecially ariſeth
that ſundry true hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,<note place="margin">Many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their infirmities.</note>
very conſcionable in their
conuerſation, be yet much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of their beſt duties haue
little comfort in any thing they
doe, and ſo looſe if not all, yet
much fruit of great labour: ſo
that it cannot be but welcome
inſtruction to them, to heare and
learne how they may be aſſured
that their weake obedience ſhall
be pleaſing to God, as if it were
without fault.</p>
            <p>In both which I will doe my
beſt, to draw out of the <hi>welles of
ſaluation,</hi> the holy Scriptures, ſuch
ſweete promiſes as ſhall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfie the thirſtie ſoule,
whoſe chiefe deſire is nothing
more then <hi>to haue grace whereby
they may ſerue God acceptably
with reuerence and godly feare.</hi>

               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:29133:156"/>
               <hi>And firſt to begin with the
former,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How wee may be ſure wee ſhall want no grace.</note> 
               <hi>that we may aſſure our

ſaid ſo much,</hi> Pſal. 84.
11. For the Lord God is a Sunne
and ſhield: The Lord will giue
grace and glory, no good thing will
he with-hold from them that walke
vprightly. <hi>Which being ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
I nothing doubt but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
this grace of holineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt. To this end alſo
doth the Lord ſo often promiſe
to ſanctifie and make holy his
people, as</hi> Exod. 19. 6. 31. 13.
Leu. 20. 8. 21. 8. 22. 32. Deut.
22. 8. 9. Eſa. 4. 3. 35. 8. Joel 3. 17.
<hi>I ſpare to ſet downe the words
which they that liſt may eaſily
reade. Againe, to the ſame end
God promiſeth to make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fruitfull, and ſo compareth
himſelfe to a good husband-man,
as in the 15. of</hi> Iohn, I am the
Vine, and my Father is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:29133:157"/>
Euery branch that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not fruit he taketh away, and
euery branch that beareth fruit he
purgeth it, that it may bring forth
more fruite. <hi>So,</hi> Eſa. 27. 2, 3. In

fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and

            <p>
               <hi>This alſo is meant where the
Lord as a good ſhepheard ſaith,
he will feede his people that they
may be fat, that is, abounding in
grace, as</hi> Pſal. 23. Ezek. 34. 13,

therefore I may boldly aſſure my

dutie which the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

            <p>But becauſe of all theſe, the

that ſo we might more willingly

            <p>And firſt, whereas we be all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
(euen after regeneration)
in many things, what is Gods
will, and how to performe ſuch
things as God requireth (as may
bee ſeene in thoſe ſpeciall duties
before named in euery comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:)
and this hath beene of

where the zeale and faith of

their hearts; whereof I ſpake
a little before vpon occaſion: that
God would make his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to obey his ſtatutes and doe
his commandements, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without a new heart, and
none can haue that, but from
God; for it is not in man to ſet
his heart aright, but this is Gods
gift. As beſides the former Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that is manifeſt, <hi>Ierem. 31.
33.</hi> Where the Prophet ſpeaking
of the new Teſtament, which
God would make to his people
vnder the Goſpell, ſaith, <hi>I will put
my Law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> which
is twice repeated in the Epiſt. to
the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 8. 10. 10. 16. which
is alſo intended, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9.
where it is ſaid of the Gentiles
to whom <hi>Peter</hi> preached, <hi>that
God purified their hearts by faith,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:29133:161"/>
and in the next chapter, that <hi>the
Lord opened the heart of</hi> Lydia.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note>
Againe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 22.</note> that <hi>God hath giuen the
earneſt of his Spirit in our hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 17. and 4. 6.</note>
               <hi>that God hath ſhined into our

               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>keepes our hearts, ſtabliſheth

               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 4.</note> and the like
many.</p>
            <p>From whence wee may ſafely
gather this,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> That though our
hearts bee neuer ſo corrupt, ſo
hardned and ſhut vp, ſo darkned,
diſtreſſed, declining, fainting,
and wandring out of the right
way; yet that God (as he hath
promiſed) will certainly ſuccour
vs in all; and both ſet and keepe
our hearts in frame, that they
may be fit for all ſuch ſeruices as
it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to ſet vs
about.</p>
            <p>This I doubt not, will be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
newes to all ſound hearted
profeſſours, who ſo much ſee and
bewaile their naughtie and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
hearts, that they may
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:29133:162"/>
comfortably reſt vpon God, that
he will by his holy Spirit ſo guide
their hearts, that they may be
ſeruiceable to him.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the heart in
generall. Now ſeeing the Lord
contents not himſelfe herewith,
but comes more particularly to
the well ordering of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of ioy, loue, feare, truſt, and
the like; we ſhall finde it vſefull
for vs, to apply to our ſelues
theſe promiſes, to hearten vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all our doubts, concerning
theſe affections, which are as the
hands and feete of our ſoules, by
which we worke and be carried
to euery dutie: that being well
furniſhed with theſe, we ſhall be
more apt and ready to euery
good worke.</p>
            <p>And whereas among theſe,<note place="margin">God giues faith, truſt, and hope.</note>
there are none more profitable
then <hi>Faith,</hi> truſt and hope (which
three though they haue ſome
ſpeciall difference one from the
other,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> yet they be neuer parted,<note place="margin">Eccle. 5. 1.</note>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:29133:162"/>
and bee vſually contained one
within another, and ſo we will
take them together:) Of theſe
the Scripture exceeding oft wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth,
that God giues theſe to
all thoſe whom hee meanes to
ſaue. As <hi>Iude verſe</hi> 3. ſaith of
Faith, that it was <hi>once giuen to the

            <p>

wherein God giues, and by

Ieſus is both Author and finiſher

            <p>Come wee now to the next

of our faith, which is Ioy, I
meane ſpirituall ioy, which is
called ioy in the Lord, and <hi>ioy in
the holy Ghost.</hi> In thinking where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I cannot but wonder, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
together what God hath
promiſed, and how little we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy:
for howſoeuer it cannot be
denied, but in theſe daies of
peace many haue ioy enough,
and too much too, yet this (vpon
ſearch) ſhall be found to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and fleeting, not that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and laſting ioy, which God
beſtoweth on thoſe whom hee
loues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:29133:164"/>
It may euidently appeare by
Gods word, that as a father
would haue his children to liue
cheerefully, ſo would God; and
therefore doth hee ſo much call
vpon them to reioyce, as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
is to be ſeene in the bookes
of the Pſalmes, Prophets, and
Apoſtles: That one for many
may ſerue, <hi>Reioyce in the Lord

               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and againe I ſay reioyce.</hi>
Which if there were no more,
might let vs ſee Gods mind, that
he would haue vs not now and
then, ſometimes to reioyce, that
is, when all goes well with vs (for
ſo the hypocrites doe,) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,

            <p>It ſhall be therefore our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

wherein we ſhall ſee how plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
the Lord hath prepared this

               <hi>This is notably ſet out vnto vs
in the booke of the Pſalmes. As
firſt,</hi> Pſal. 19. 8. The ſtatutes of
the Lord are right, reioycing the
heart. Pſal. 23. 4. Thy rod and thy
ſtaffe they comfort mee: 36. 8. 9.
Thou ſhalt make them drinke of the
riuer of thy pleaſure; for with thee is
the fountaine of Life, and in thy
light ſhall we ſee light. 89. 15, 16.
Bleſſed are the people that know
the ioyfull ſound: they ſhall walke
O Lord, in the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
In thy name ſhall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
all the day, and in thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
ſhall they be exalted. <hi>So</hi>
Pſal. 45. 15. <hi>Speaking of the
members of the Church, ſaith,</hi>
With gladneſſe and reioycing ſhall
they be brought, they ſhall enter into
the Kings pallace. Pſal. 64. 10. The
righteous ſhall be glad in the Lord,
and ſhall truſt in the Lord, and all
the vpright in heart ſhall glory.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 3. But let the righteous
be glad, let them reioyce before
God, yea let them exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:29133:165"/>
97. 11. 12. Light is ſowne for
the righteous, and gladneſſe for
the vpright in heart: Reioyce in the
Lord ye righteous, and giue thankes
at the remembrance of his holines,
118. 15. The voice of reioycing and
ſaluation is in the tabernacle of the
righteous, The right hand of the
Lord doth valiantly, 126. 5, 6.
They that ſowe in teares ſhall reape
in ioy. Hee that goeth foorth and

doubtleſſe come againe with reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
bringing his ſheanes with him,
132. 16; I will cloathe her prieſts

of the Pſalmes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Therefore with ioy ſhall yee drawe

ſort ſpake our Sauiour to his

Therefore they ſhall come and ſing

them, and make them reioyce from
their ſorrow. Zach. <hi>c.</hi> 18. 19. Thus
ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the faſt of
the fourth moneth, &amp;c. ſhall bee to
the houſe of Iudah, ioy and gladnes,

with that,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:29133:167"/>
of God is righteouſnes, peace,
and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I gathered ſtore of
theſe promiſes,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> in which the
Lord promiſeth to giue ioy and
gladneſſe to his people: yet I
ſuppoſe not halfe ſo many, as
might bee collected out of the
ſcriptures: for I doe not meddle
with the many exhortations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this duty, nor the many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of it, nor prayers for it: all
which ſhew the necesſity of
it.</p>
            <p>But the marke I aime at, is to
perſwade all who feele the want
of this holy reioycing in the Lord
(whereby their whole life is the
more vncomfortable,) that God
hath prouided this for them, and
that there is nothing but their
vnbeleeuing hearts which keepes
it from them. For if true faith be
the breeder of this ioy, as both
ſcripture and experience prooue,
then no meruaile, that ſo few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to this excellent grace of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29133:167"/>
reioycing, when faith it ſelfe is ſo
weake, if not wanting.</p>
            <p>I do wiſh therefore all ſuch, to
thinke with themſelues what the
Lord ſhould intend, in making
ſo many promiſes of this one
thing, but to make vs ſee theſe
two things: firſt, that there can
be no holding out in a Chriſtian
courſe without this ioy: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that by reaſon of the many
euills that befall vs in this life,
it is very hard, and ſo very rare
to get, much more to keepe this
ioy, that by both theſe, they may
be ſtirred vp to labour to enioy
this ioy of the Holy Ghoſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may finde what is the
excellencie of this eſtate aboue
all the eſtates in the whole world
beſides; and be ſo far from enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wicked in their greateſt
proſperity, as rather to pitty
them, for that like fooles and
children, they forgoe ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for very toyes and bables.</p>
            <p>Now the way to attaine this
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29133:168"/>
ioye is, (beſides earneſt praier
vnto God for it) to bee much in
meditation, as vpon the manie
and moſt iuſt cauſes God hath
giuen to all beleeuers to reioice:
ſo alſo vpon theſe excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
wherein God hath bound
himſelfe to worke this grace in
them, by his holie Spirit: for if
we well weigh them all, we ſhall
ſee, that the Lords meaning is
not onelie to giue them matter
of reioicing, (but whereas it too
oft falles out, that they who
ſhould reioice, and haue good
good cauſe ſo to doe, bee ſo held
downe with the burthen of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
or affliction, that they
cannot lift vp their hands with
ioy, but waſte their daies in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:)
This is alſo Gods worke
to open their eies to ſee, and to
mooue their hearts, and drawe
them by his Spirit to be affected
with his fauours, that they with
the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> may finde
more ioy in the light of Gods
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:29133:168"/>
countenance, then the wicked
haue in all their proſperity. And
thus much for this point, how a
true beleeuer may attaine this
bleſſed eſtate of liuing ioyfullie,
what euer doth befall him: which
how much it is to be deſired, all
may ſee though they bee fewe,
who take the right way to get
it.</p>
            <p>The next grace of the heart,
which God requireth of all thoſe,<note place="margin">Of the loue of God.</note>
whom he hath adopted in Chriſt
to bee his children,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 5.</note> is, that they
<hi>ſhould loue him with all their heart,
with all their ſoule, with all their
might:</hi> which that wee ought to
doe is not denyed of any, except
Atheiſts, people without God;
but of thoſe that yeeld it ought
to be, there bee in generall two
ſorts, one that deceiue themſelues
in thinking they doe well loue
God, when as indeede they doe
not truely and heartily loue him,
but onely ſay they loue him; or
if they doe, it is but very ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29133:169"/>
and carnallie, becauſe all goes
well with them:<note place="margin">Some ſay they loue God, and doe not.</note> who are to bee
conuinced by their looſe liues,
and little conſcience to keepe
Gods commaundements, that
they doe not as they ſay, truely
loue God. And theſe eſpeciallie
are to bee vrged by the many
commandements of God to loue
him ſincerely and feruently, and
to bee mooued hereto by theſe
weighty arguments, which are ſo
plentifully vſed in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to perſwade vs vnfeinedlie
to loue God.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort, who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into their liues, and there
finding ſo many infirmities and
failings in all duties to God and
man,<note place="margin">Others feare they doe not loue, yet doe.</note> doe thence conclude, they
haue not the loue of God in
them; and thereby be much kept
downe, both from that comfort
and confidence they might haue
in their holy profesſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the perſons with whom
I chieflie deale: who haue neede
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:29133:169"/>
to be hartened, firſt by this, that
the ſight of their want of loue to
God,<note place="margin">Comforts to ſuch as grieue for want of loue.</note> breeding in them heartie
griefe for the ſame, is an euident
token there is ſome true loue in
them: elſe would they not be ſo
diſquieted for want of this loue
of God.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, this muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, that hee who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them to will and deſire this
grace,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13. 1. 6.</note> will alſo giue them ability
to doe, and hee that <hi>hath begun
the good worke, will alſo perfect it,</hi>
for ſo is his promiſe: yea he hath
ſaid, at leaſt to all, and euery ſuch,
<hi>And the Lord thy God will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
thine heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 306.</note> 
               <hi>and the heart
of thy ſeed, to loue the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy
ſoule, that thou maieſt liue:</hi> which
one promiſe, if there be no more,
is al-ſufficient to perſwade thoſe
that will beleeue God on his
word, that God (who knowes
how polluted our hearts be, and
vnable to loue him, ſo throughly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:29133:170"/>
as we ought,) will cleanſe our
hearts, and ſo ſanctifie them, that
wee ſhall bee able by his grace ſo
to loue him, as hee will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue.</p>
            <p>It is onely vnbeliefe, which

            <p>Although I doe not reade any
other ſo expreſſe promiſe, that
God will make vs to loue him,
yet ſeeing the manifeſtation of
Gods loue to vs, doth as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
breed loue in vs to him again,
as the kindling of a fire wil bring
foorth heate: therefore all the
many teſtimonies which God
giues of his loue to vs, muſt be ſo
many perſwaſions, that wee ſhall
loue him. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>We
loue him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe.</note>

God, as to bee very vnwilling to

of the want of this grace,
and deſire it, and labour for it, by
often prayer, and other holy
meanes: yet through weakneſſe
of faith, cannot attaine to ſuch a
meaſure of this feare, as might
keepe them in ſuch awe, that
they durſt not either doe that
which God forbids, or leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
that which he commands.</p>
            <p>Theſe I doe beſeech to attend
to ſuch promiſes as God hath
made to his people in particular,
concerning this grace; that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ſees, that naturally, there is
no feare of God before mens
eyes, he faith he will put his feare
into their hearts: as <hi>Ieremy, 32.
39. 40. And I will giue them one
heart, and one way, that they may
feare me for euer, for the good of
them, and of their children after
them. And I will make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
couenant with them, that
I will not turne away from them, to
doe them good, but I will put my
feare in their hearts that they ſhall
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29133:171"/>
not depart from me.</hi> Which if we
could beleeue, would ſufficiently
aſſure vs, wee ſhould not want
this ſauing grace, but that God
will certainely beſtowe it vpon
vs in that time and meaſure hee
ſees meete.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for our confirmation,
the Lord doth oft repeate
this promiſe, as</hi> Deu. 4. 10. <hi>where
one ſpeciall meanes, wherby this
feare is wrought, is ſet downe:</hi>
Gather me the people together, and
I will make them heare my words,
that they may learne to feare mee
all the daies that they ſhall liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  </gap>.</hi> 5.
They who ſeeke for wiſedome, ſhall

it is ſpecially ſpoken of the king:
and more generally of all, chap.
32. 12. And to this purpoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
is that of the Prophet</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Pſal. 40. 3. <hi>where hee ſhewes
another meanes whereby God
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29133:172"/>
doth ſtirre vp this grace in his

of Gods mercy on others, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
And hee hath put a new ſong
in my mouth, euen praiſe vnto our
God, many ſhall ſee it, and feare, and
ſhall truſt in the Lord: <hi>ſo likewiſe</hi>
Dauid <hi>being taught of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth

honour before all the nations of the

I doe vnto them; and they ſhall feare
and tremble for all the goodnes, and
for all the proſperitie that I procure

ſhall the people of Iſrael returne and
ſeeke the Lord their God, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
their king, and ſhall feare the
Lord and his goodnes in the latter
daies.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſhall ſuffiſe, it would be
long to cite all.</p>
            <p>The right vſe we are to make
of theſe and the like,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> is, ſo oft as
we finde our hearts condemning
vs for want of this feare, &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
how euer we ſhall attaine to
it in any good meaſure, ſo oft
that wee muſt call to mind ſome
of theſe promiſes, which though
deliuered in particular to ſome
of Gods children, yet in truth
belonging to all of them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euery child of God may and
ought to apply them to himſelfe,
and ſtedfaſtly beleeue that God
will performe his word to him,
and ſo waiting with patience
the Lords appointed ſeaſon, hee
ſhall not bee diſappointed of his
hope: but ſhall certainly enioy
the fruit of his deſire, And thus
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:29133:173"/>
much for this.</p>
            <p>I ſee this third point, how wee
may bee ſure of grace to leade a
godly life, ſo as ſhall be accepted,
growes large; and no meruaile,
for it reacheth to all the duties
required in both tables. I may not
therefore runne into all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but will make choice of
ſome, and namely ſuch as I
conceiue Chriſtians moſt faile in,
and haue leaſt comfort in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort be ſpeciall,<note place="margin">Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning holy exerciſes, prayer. &amp;c.</note> all our
ſpirituall ſeruices of God, as our
praiers, and exerciſes in his word
and ſacraments. In all which I
haue heard many of good hope,
complaining that they found
ſmall comfort in theſe, becauſe
they performed them in ſo weak
and ſinnefull manner. A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
cauſe whereof I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in many to be this, that they
placed all their comfort in the
good diſcharge of their duty,
wherein when they failed (which
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29133:173"/>
they found oft) then they were
diſcomfited. Which euidently
ſhewes, that they had little vſe of
faith in thoſe duties: for faith
doth comfort in our greateſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as well as in the leaſt. To
make this more plaine (which I
feare is little ſeene of manie a
poore ſoule, who takes great
paines to ſerue God, and yet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
findes comfort, that his
ſeruice being ſo full of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is pleaſing to God:) It muſt
be confeſſed, that while wee liue
here, there is fleſh and ſpirit min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in all the actions of Gods
children; ſo that as their beſt
prayers bee ſtained with ſome
corruption of the fleſh, ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that there is ſome operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit in their weakeſt,
which being offered vp in faith,
is aſſuredly acceptable to God; &amp;
therein may Gods childe finde
ſound comfort, not in himſelfe,
nor in his worke, but in Gods
pardoning of all his defects, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29133:174"/>
accepting his obedience in the
perfect ſatisfaction made by
Chriſt: whereas otherwiſe, if any
hauing prayed with great feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Spirit, ſhall bee conceited
therewith, and not humbled for
his failings in that his beſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and rather expecting for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
for the goodneſſe of his
prayer, then looking for mercy,
onely for the merite of Chriſt,
(which though it bee too little
ſeene, yet too oft it falleth out)
I durſt boldly ſay, that the ſleepy
prayer offered vp in faith, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
when the weeping prayer
without faith is reiected.</p>
            <p>In ſo ſaying,<note place="margin">Want of faith in Gods worſhip.</note> be it far from my
thought, to approoue of drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or any other groſſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in prayer: or to diſgrace any
zeale or gift of Gods Spirit in
prayer; but that I aime at, is to
diſcouer a common, and yet
cloſe and dangerous corruption
in our prayers, and other holy
exerciſes, that when we performe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:29133:174"/>
theſe in any ſort to our liking,
then wee bee glad and reſt quiet,
that God will accept them. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but ſuch may then reioice
in the asſiſtance of Gods Spirit:
but the fault I finde, is, that theſe
haue in ſuch times little vſe of
their faith; for not beholding the
blemiſhes of theſe their beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
of God, they are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for them, and ſo not driuen
out of themſelues to ſeeke for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
in Chriſt, in whom alone
God is well pleaſed: and thus
they ſtaine their beſt duties for
want of faith.</p>
            <p>This will more cleerely bee
ſeene in the contrary, when theſe
doe pray, or heare, reade or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
or receiue the Sacraments
with much accuſation to their
conſcience, they haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that ſuch duties ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which muſt needs ariſe
from want of faith; for did they
in their pooreſt praiers (for
which they bee moſt humbled)
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29133:175"/>
come to God in Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
beleeuing that their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
ſhould bee couered by
the full and perfect ſatisfaction
of Chriſt, they might finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in their weakeſt obedience,
and ſo bee more encouraged to
ſerue God.</p>
            <p>This then is that I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all that would finde ſound
and laſting comfort in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and other holy exerciſes,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> in
their beſt duties to beware of
pride, which accompanieth them;
and to that end euer to thinke of
their failings, to humble them,
and driue to Chriſt, that ſo they
may offer vp their ſacrifice in
faith, and bee accepted. On the
other ſide, when they be moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
then to beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
doubting, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which bee vſuall compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of vs in the ſenſe of our
wants; and to comfort our ſelues
by faith in Chriſt, in that wee
know, hee is as able and willing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29133:175"/>
to cure great diſeaſes, as ſmall,
to pardon our fowler falles, as
our leſſer ſlippes.</p>
            <p>In all which wee now ſee that
which I intended, how needfull it
is to be ſtored and ſtrengthened
with faith, that wee may finde
comfort in our prayers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holy exerciſes; which I know
is much wanting in many true
hearted Chriſtians, for whoſe
ſake in ſpeciall I write theſe: and
will now for their further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
lay out ſome ſtore of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſes, which God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath treaſured vp in his
word to this purpoſe, that wee
his children might bee imbolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to come with confidence to
him in all our necesſities.</p>
            <p>Peruſing theſe, I finde that the
farre greater number of them,
doe ſpecially promiſe that God
will accept our prayers, &amp; grant
our deſires, and doe not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
aſſure vs that God will
asſiſt vs, and make vs able to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29133:176"/>
pray (which yet ſundry promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
doe.)<note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to make vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pray.</note> I will therefore heere
gather ſuch as expreſly promiſe
Gods helpe to teach vs to pray;
for that we are no leſſe ſubiect to
doubt of our ability to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
then of Gods readineſſe to
heare our poore and weake
prayers.</p>
            <p>Among all, that comes firſt
to minde, which might ſerue in
ſtead of all, if we could hold it
faſt: where the Apoſtle labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to comfort the hearts of
Gods children ouer all their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and afflictions,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> doth
anſwer a great obiection, which
many a heauy heart makes,
namely this:<note place="margin">Many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray.</note> I am oft ſo diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that I am not able to pray,
and how then may I looke for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
helpe at Gods hand? Thus it
fareth oft with Gods children,
and thoſe not of the weakeſt ſort,
that their hearts bee ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
that they can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſigh and groane, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29133:176"/>
to ſet aright their hearts to
pray to God. As wee reade of
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 38. 14.</note> that <hi>he like a Crane or
Swallow did chatter, and did
mourne as a Doue,</hi> not able to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his griefes to God. The like
we reade of <hi>Dauid</hi> oft,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> how <hi>hee
roared for griefe,</hi> but could not
come to make his moane to
God; and the like many: Yea
what more ordinary complaint
doe wee heare made by many
worthy Chriſtians in their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
then this to their friends,
O helpe me, I cannot pray?</p>
            <p>To this ſore tentation, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
anſwers,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> ſaying, <hi>Likewiſe
the Spirit helpeth our infirmities,
for we know not what wee ſhould
pray for,</hi>
               <note place="margin">27.</note> 
               <hi>as we ought: But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for
vs with groanings that cannot bee
vttered: And hee that ſearcheth
the hearts, knoweth what is the
minde of the ſpirit, becauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
interceſſion for the Saints ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of God.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:29133:177"/>
he freely confeſſeth, that he
and all the reſt of Gods children
doe know this by woefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that they in ſuch caſes know
not what they ſhould pray as
they ought. But yet for all this
God hath not left vs comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
for he hath giuen vs his own
<hi>Spirit to ſuccour and helpe vs</hi> (as it
were to beare that part of the
burthe, which is too heauy for vs
to beare:) and whereas <hi>we cannot
pray as we ought,</hi> that ſelfe ſame
Spirit ſhall by his power make vs
able to pray with ſuch feeling,
faith, and feruencie, as no words
can expreſſe; in ſuch ſort that
God, who both knowes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
the ſecret deſires of the
heart, beholding the worke of
his Spirit, doth graciouſly accept
and approoue of thoſe prayers
of his children.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt, but this is
the intent of the Apoſtle in this
Scripture. In which if there were
no more, is enough to comfort
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29133:177"/>
any poore afflicted ſoule againſt
this temptation, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray: In that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs his Spirit ſo to helpe vs,
that our poore prayers are ſaid
to be the prayers of Gods Spirit
in vs, which God cannot deny.</p>
            <p>This I take to bee the cauſe,
why elſe-where we be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pray in <hi>the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> and in
<hi>the holy Ghoſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iude v. 20.</note> that is, as he doth
teach vs, not as any naturall gift
can.</p>
            <p>Where I note a ſpeciall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of true prayer from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,<note place="margin">Difference of prayers, true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and counterfeit</note>
which may be excellent in

of Gods Spirit, it is but a dead

vnprofitable to him that offereth
it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I aduiſe all, who
looke for comfort by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
more to labour for Spirit,
then ſpeech in prayers. And ſo
much for this Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I haue ſtood the longer,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29133:178"/>
for that it may ſuffiſe in ſtead of

might be cited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The maine intent of them all,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
is not ſo much, to ſhew it is our
duty thus to ſeeke the Lord and
to call vpon him, or to perſwade
thereunto, which is in many
Scriptures required; but rather,
whereas many are very willing
to call vpon God according to
his will, and ſo as might pleaſe
him, but finding ſo ſmall abilitie
to pray as they would, they
be diſcouraged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all this is to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29133:179"/>
draw them to beleeue, that God
by his Spirit will teach them to
pray, ſo as he will heare them:
the certainty whereof depends
not vpon any worthineſſe of our
perſons or prayers, but only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the mercy of God in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and vpon his truth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his promiſe; both which
we deny, and ſo robbe God of his
chiefeſt honour, if wee beleeue
not, that God will make vs able
by his Spirit, ſo to call vpon
him, as he will accept in his Son.
And therefore in all our doubts
and feares about this matter, our
onely refuge muſt bee to theſe
promiſes, and ſo to giue credite
vnto them, that we comfortably
ſeeke and looke for helpe from
God, when we can finde none in
our ſelues.</p>
            <p>And thus much for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that God will aſsiſt vs by his
Spirit in our prayers, which alſo
might ſuffiſe to aſſure vs, that he
will alſo accept vs: for ſo much
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29133:180"/>
is expreſſed in the moſt of them,
and neceſſarily imployed in them
all.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord (who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſees what we moſt need,<note place="margin">That God will accept our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> then
we doe our ſelues) hath made ſo
many promiſes, that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our poore ſeruices, though
neuer ſo weake, if they be in truth
(which will be welcome newes
to many an humble heart) I may
not defraud them of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
but will lay them open for
their vſe, and beſeech the Lord
to make them profitable to all
that vnfainedly deſire it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> from God had
ſharply denounced feareful iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt Iſrael for their ſin,
and namely a ſcattering among
the heathen, he addes this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
<hi>But if from thence, thou ſhalt
ſeeke the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt
finde him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30.</note> 
               <hi>if thou ſeeke him with all
thy heart and with all thy ſoule:</hi> and
to like effect hee addes much
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:29133:180"/>
This promiſe may be ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comfortable,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> to any poore
ſoule caſt downe in ſenſe of ſome
grieuous fall, whereby he may
ſee Gods readineſſe to receiue
any poore ſinner comming vnto
him. The like promiſe did the
Lord make to <hi>Salomon</hi> after his
prayer, ſaying, <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be
open,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chron. 7. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and mine eares attend to the
prayer in this place.</hi> And full oft
we reade, that the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to his people, that if they
ſhould ſeeke him, he would bee
found of them, as 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2
the Prophet told <hi>Aſa</hi> the King.
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 29. 13. And 1. <hi>Chron. 28. 9.
Dauid</hi> ſaid the ſame to <hi>Salomon</hi>
his ſonne. <hi>Pſal. 34. 10. They that
ſeeke the Lord, ſhall not want any
good thing.</hi> The ſelfe ſame thing
is truly to be gathered out of all
theſe places where the faithfull
profeſſe, either that God hath
heard their prayers, or their faith
and confidence in God, that hee
will heare their prayers; both
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29133:181"/>
which be grounded on Gods
promiſes that hee will heare
them. Of this ſort there be many,
as in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> ſo in ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures: <hi>The Lord hath
heard the voice of my weeping,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>the
Lord hath heard my ſupplication,
the Lord will receiue my prayer.</hi>
And <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. Thou Lord haſt
not forſaken them that ſeeke thee.</hi>
Pſal. 10. 17. <hi>Lord thou haſt heard
the deſire of the humble, thou wilt
prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe
thine eare to heare.</hi> Pſal. 18. 3. <hi>I
will call vpon the Lord, who is
worthy to be praiſed: ſo ſhall I bee
ſaued from mine enemies.</hi> Pſal. 20. 6
<hi>Now I know the Lord ſaueth his
annointed, hee will heare him from
his holy heauen, with the ſauing
ſtrength of his right hand.</hi> Theſe
are ſufficient to manifeſt this
truth.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing my ſcope is rather to
ſtirre vp to beleeue, I hope it
will not be more tedious to any,
to reade theſe and conſider them,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29133:181"/>
then it is to me to gather them;
and I may truely ſay, I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
read them with comfort.
For ſometimes one, ſometimes
another doth more affect. I will
therefore not ſpare to adde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this purpoſe, notable is
that in the</hi> Pſalme 34. 15. The
eyes of the Lord are vpon the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and his eares are open to their
cry. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. The righteous cry,
and the Lord heareth, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them out of all their troubles.
<hi>Which is oft repeated,</hi> Pſal. 107.
6. 13. 19. 28. Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>the
Lord ſaith,</hi> Call vpon me in the day
of trouble, I will deliuer thee, and
thou ſhalt glorifie me. <hi>And,</hi> For thou
Lord art good and ready to forgiue,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86. 5.</note>
and plenteous in mercy to all them
that call vpon thee, &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. 7.
Pſal. 102, 17. He will regard the
prayer of the deſtitute, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
their prayer, <hi>to</hi> verſe 20:
to heare the groaning of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to looſe thoſe that are appointed
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:29133:182"/>
to death.<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 18.</note> The Lord is nigh to all
that call vpon him, to all that call
vpon him in truth. He will fulfill
the deſire of them that feare him,<note place="margin">19.</note>
he alſo will heare their cry, and will
ſaue them. <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 8. But the
prayer of the vpright is his delight,
<hi>and</hi> verſe 29. <hi>But</hi> hee heareth the
prayer of the righteous. He will
be very gracious vnto thee, at the
voice of thy cry, when he ſhall heare
it, he will anſwer thee. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 32.
And it ſhal come to paſſe, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
ſhall call on the name of the
Lord ſhall be deliuered. <hi>Act. 2. 21.
the ſame is repeated, and</hi> Rom.
10. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus wee ſee how plentifully
hath beene renewed this promiſe
of hearing the prayers of his
people, in all ages of his Church
vntill Chriſt, who (knowing that
wee vnder the Goſpell haue as
great neede, both to pray and to
bee comforted, that God will
heare our prayers) hath giuen vs
many incouragements to pray
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29133:182"/>
in faith,</hi> Aske and it ſhall be giuen
you, ſeeke and ye ſhall finde:<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> knocke
and it ſhall be opened vnto you, For
euery one that asketh, receiueth, and
he that ſeeketh, findeth, and to him
that knocketh, ſhall it bee opened.
<hi>The ſame is ſet downe, Luk. 11.
from verſe 9. to 13. where it is
ſaid,</hi> If ye then being euill, know
how to giue good gifts vnto your
children: how much more ſhall
your heauenly Father giue the holy
Spirit to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that aske him? <hi>So our
Sauior ſaid to the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
If thou kneweſt the gift of

            <p>
               <hi>Likewiſe in thoſe heauenly and
laſt ſpeeches, which he vttered to
his Diſciples, hee oft repeated
thoſe promiſes, ſaying:</hi> Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

any thing in my name, I will doe
it. <hi>The like oft, Ioh. 15. 7. 16. 16.
23. and</hi> 24. Aske and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that your ioy may be full: <hi>ſo
the Apoſtle,</hi>

the like ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 22</note> And whatſoeuer
we aske of him, we receiue. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. 14.</note>
And this is the confidence
we haue in him, that if we aske any
thing according to his will, hee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vs, And if wee know that hee
heareth vs,<note place="margin">15.</note> whatſoeuer we aske, we
know that wee haue the petitions
that we deſired of him. <hi>And in the

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue wee ſtore of theſe
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29133:183"/>
promiſes, wherein the Lord bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe, to heare our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and grant our requeſts; the
end of all which is to cure this
ſore diſeaſe of our nature,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that
we be ſo full of diſtruſt, and ſo
hardly beleeue that God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our prayers, they being ſo
weake, and our ſelues ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
For remedy whereof we are
to be familiarly acquainted with
theſe promiſes, &amp; to make choice
of ſome of them, ſuch as to our
feeling are moſt comfortable;
that when we goe to prayer, we
may meditate on them, that ſo
we may bee perſwaded by them,
that God will graciouſly pardon
all our failings, and accept our
poore indeauours in the perfect
ſatisfaction made by Chriſt for
vs. The fruite of this practiſe
would be exceeding great, both
to breede in vs a greater delight
in this holy dutie, (which vſually
is ſo much wanting:) And to
make all our prayers more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29133:184"/>
for the obtaining of all
good things, at the hand of God.
Whereas on the other ſide, by
neglecting this dutie of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on theſe promiſes, we ſhall
diſable our ſelues from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
practiſe of prayer, and
become more guilty not onely
of contempt of Gods bounty in
making ſuch promiſes vnto vs:
but withall of greater impietie,
in making the holy &amp; true God
a lyer, in that wee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
him in that which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
Therefore as wee deſire to
auoide theſe ſore euils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
theſe great benefits, let vs
make high account of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and ſo make them our
owne, that wee may haue the
right vſe of them, eſpecially in all
time of neede.</p>
            <p>This which hath beene ſaid of
Gods gracious accepting of our
prayers,<note place="margin">All ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> may as truly be applyed
to all other holy exerciſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and ſeruices of God. In
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:29133:184"/>
all of which the Lord is as ready
both to enable vs to the worke,
and to be pleaſed with our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
indeauours, wee offering
them vp to God with faith in
the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing beſides theſe, wee
haue many promiſes, that God
will be pleaſed with our ſacrifices
(which may be truly vnderſtood
of all) it will adde to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
if we ſhall aduiſedly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them: of which ſort is that
in the <hi>Pſal. 51. 19. Then ſhalt

               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 19.</note>

brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye preſent your bodies a liuing
ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
which is your reaſonable ſeruice.</hi>
The Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tell his people, that they
offering vp their ſacrifices, ſuch
as he commanded, <hi>they ſhould be
accepted,</hi> as <hi>Leuit. 1. 4. 22. 21. 23.
11.</hi> 26. 11. So <hi>Malachy 3. 4. Then
ſhall the offerings of Iudah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
be pleaſant to the Lord, as
in the dayes of old, and as in former
yeeres.</hi> This alſo may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> told
the people of Iſrael from the
Lord, that they bringing their
ſacrifices to the doore of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of the congregation,
<hi>There hee would meete the people
of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 29. 43.</note> 
               <hi>and the Tabernacle ſhould
bee ſanctified by his glory.</hi> Which
may bee gathered out of that
which followeth, that the Lord
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29133:185"/>
would dwell among them, and be
their God, to heare and helpe
them, which is elſe-where oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 60. 7. foreſhewed this
ſaying, <hi>They ſhal come with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
&amp;c.</hi> And hitherto may be
well referred the many fauours
which God promiſeth to our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
which is an acceptable
ſacrifice to God, offered vp in
Chriſt. As the Lord ſaid vnto
<hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>If thou doe well, ſhalt thou not

ſaid to his people of Iſrael in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them to heare his Law:
<hi>Now therefore if yee will obey my

               <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and keepe my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>And ye ſhall bee
vnto me a kingdome of Prieſts, and
an holy nation.</hi> Leuit. 26. 3. to 14.
and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 1. to 14. be many
ſpeciall bleſsings promiſed to the
Lords people if they would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to his voyce, and obſerue and

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29133:186"/>
to conclude with that ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Pſal. 84. 11. For the Lord
God is a Sunne and ſhield, the Lord
will giue grace and glory: no good
thing will hee withhold from them
that walke vprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of theſe promiſes and the
like many,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> we may boldly aſſure
our ſelues, that although by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our corruption ſtill dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in vs, we can neuer offer vp
any ſacrifice to God, without
blemiſh and ſpot, (for which God
might iuſtly reiect all, which we
offer vnto him) yet wee offering
them vp in the name of Chriſt,
they ſhall be accepted and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Were wee well perſwaded
heereof, it would put life into vs,
and make vs performe all holy
duties much more cheerefully
and conſtantly, which through
want of this faith, are at leaſt
more vncomfortably performed
by vs.</p>
            <p>I leaue the deeper conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29133:186"/>
of both theſe, to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of euery one who will take
triall of himſelfe, namely, what
ſmall comfort he findes in any of
his ſpirituall ſeruices; and on the
other ſide, what a comfort it
would be, if he might be aſſured
that God would both aſsiſt him,
and accept them at his hand.
Whereof ſeeing he hath God ſo
firmely bound by promiſe, that
he cannot without great ſinne,
wrong to God and to his owne
owne ſoule, call this into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:</p>
            <p>I therefore exhort all who ſee
their weakeneſſe in this kinde, to
take ſpeciall notice of theſe and
ſuch like promiſes, and ſo euery
one apply them to himſelfe, in all
time of neede, that he may more
cheerefully ſet vpon all holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and more conſcionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them to the glory of God,
and his owne comfort, and the
good incouragement of others.</p>
            <p>This which hath beene ſaid in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29133:187"/>
ſpeciall for prayer, and ſo in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
for all our ſacrifices, may
well bee applyed to the Word
and Sacraments, yea to all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
exerciſes of religion, yea to
all workes of mercy; which be all
of them ſacrifices, which God
hath commanded, and promiſed
to accept at our hands.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing woefull experience
bewrayeth that too too many
(and thoſe not of the worſt ſort)
doe finde ſmall comfort in the
ordinary miniſtery of the Word
and receiuing the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:<note place="margin">Word.</note>
I will doe my beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to redreſſe this ſore euill,
and ſhew how any who will bee
guided by Gods word, may more
cheerefully ſet vpon theſe holy
duties, and ſo reape more fruite
and comfort by them.</p>
            <p>I cannot be ignorant of this,
that there be many cauſes of this
vnfruitfulneſſe, and vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
in theſe holy ſeruices of
God, both in the Miniſter and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29133:187"/>
people, eſpecially in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, when he doth
not apply himſelfe to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and beſt edification of the
hearers: wherein there is much
failing many waies, and this not
the leaſt, that where many good
doctrines and vſes are deliuered,
yet there is not ſuch a conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the conſcience, as might
conſtraine the hearer to confeſſe
his guiltineſſe, and to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to yeeld better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to that which is taught
him.</p>
            <p>In the people alſo there is
great careleſneſſe in preparing
themſelues before they come;
dulneſſe and wandring of minde,
when they bee at the word, with
like neglect of meditating on
what they heard: By any of
which, much more by all, the
Word is made vnfruitfull.</p>
            <p>But to treat of theſe, is beyond
my ſcope and matter intended,
which is chiefely to helpe ſuch as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29133:188"/>
uing a true deſire &amp; care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by Gods holy ordinances, yet
be ſo diſcouraged by their many
infirmities in the vſe of them,
that they haue ſmall comfort in
them, and would if they durſt,
forbeare the vſe of them.</p>
            <p>The principall cauſe heereof
which I obſerue is this, that they
too much looking into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
(where they finde no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
to do what they would) and
not looking ſufficiently to God
in whom is all their helpe, they
enioy not that fruit and comfort
in Gods ſeruice which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <p>For remedy whereof I know
no better way, then to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Gods promiſes
made to ſuch as ſhall hearken to
his Word, and receiue the holy
Sacraments the ſeales of the
Word, that by theſe they may be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, that God will bleſſe his

and ſaluation. Firſt for the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29133:188"/>
hearing of the word, that which
the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh might
ſuffiſe to perſwade any (who will
giue credite to his report) that it
ſhall not be loſt labour to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to Gods word. The place is

for our purpoſe muſt bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29133:189"/>
Firſt, how freely the Lord
offereth ſauing grace to ſuch as

a diligent hearing and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Gods word. To which end

promiſes, <hi>that their ſoule ſhall liue,</hi>
that is, they ſhall be quickned in
Chriſt, and in him <hi>the ſeede of

thoſe <hi>mercies</hi> which ſhall neuer

when hee may vpon ſo good
ground aſſure himſelfe, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee ſhall attaine vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all needfull graces for
this life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is notably confirmed by
all theſe Scriptures, which teſtifie</hi>
That the word is able to ſaue our

               <hi>ſaith;</hi> And now brethren I
commend you to God, and to the
word of his grace, which is able to
build you vp, &amp; to giue you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
among all them which are
ſanctified. <hi>So likewiſe to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
hee ſaith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor, 1. 21</note> It pleaſed God
by the fooliſhnes of preaching to ſaue
them that beleeue.</p>
            <p>All which Scriptures, and many
other to like effect,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> doe euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirme vnto vs, that as there
is no ſaluation without the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, ſo whoſoeuer
ſhall conſcionably attend to it,
ſhall certainly be ſaued: which if
it were beleeued, it could not but
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29133:190"/>
make men runne to it with great
alacritie, and ſo ſhould they finde
much comfort thereby.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe bee there ſo
many commendations of the
word throughout the ſcriptures,
ſpecially in the bookes of the
Pſalmes, and of the Prouerbs. It
would be too long to cite all: yet
all are to be referred to this end,
to breede in vs a greater delight
in this word, which bringeth ſuch
incomparable benefits. Of this
ſort, are theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, &amp;c. <hi>The
Law of the Lord is perfect, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſoule: The testimonie of the
Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
The ſtatutes of the Lord are
right, reioycing the heart.</hi> And ſo
followeth to like effect in the
ſame place. The whole Pſalme
119, was written to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to ſet out the excellencie of
this word in all reſpects, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the worthy effects, and
fruits which it bringeth foorth in
euery one, who truelie embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it: ſo that it is obſerued by
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:29133:190"/>
many learned Diuines, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
176. verſes, there be ſcarce
foure or fiue at the moſt, wherein
there is not ſome commendation
of the word, to ſtirre vp all Gods
people better to eſteeme it, and
more diligently to attend to it,
that they may enioy the fruites
of it, at all times, and in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.
To which end I require
euery true Chriſtian to be much
exerciſed in this Pſalme, that
they may be familiarlie acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it, and ſo haue it in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
for their vſe in all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſities.</p>
            <p>I might ſay as much for the
booke of the Prouerbs, wherein
beſides the many, and moſt wiſe
directions for the well ordering
of our whole life, are contained
eſpecially in the firſt nine chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
admirable commendations
of thoſe heauenly inſtructions,
which God as a Father by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
doth giue vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 13.</note>
A few for many: <hi>Take faſt
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:29133:191"/>
hold of inſtruction, let her not goe:
Keepe her, for ſhe is thy life.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
what can bee more contained
then this, that inſtruction is our
life? meaning that thereby wee
attaine all things pertaining to
the comfort of this life, and of
that to come.</p>
            <p>This might be ſet out at large
in particulars, both in the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of manifold euills, ſinnes,
and puniſhments, which they
fall into, who want, or will not
receiue theſe inſtructions: as alſo
in the enioying of many bleſſings
bodily and ſpirituall, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
want: but I leaue the further
conſideration of theſe to euery
ones particular meditation, who
deſires to ſee the truth hereof.
No doubt, <hi>Dauid</hi> meant no leſſe,
when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 165.</note> 
               <hi>Great peace</hi> (is, and
ſhall be) <hi>to them that loue thy
Law: and nothing ſhal offend them.</hi>
Who would not highly priſe that
word, which brings all manner of
wiſedome, to all ſorts, learned,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29133:191"/>
vnlearned, wiſe and ſilly, olde
and young? Yet all this, doth
that one booke of the Prouerbs,
as is expreſly ſaid in the ſixe firſt
verſes of the firſt chapter, as you
may there reade; and therefore
how much more is this to bee
found in the whole Scripture?</p>
            <p>Which,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> me thinkes, ſhould put
life into any good heart, to bee
much conuerſant in the hearing,
reading, and meditating of the
word of God. For further quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
herein, I will onely quote
the places, and referre euery one
that liſteth to heare more of this
matter, to peruſe them; and ſo
ſhall he finde enough to hearten
him to this duty, Prou. 1. 9. 23.
2. from 1. <hi>to 13. 3. 1. to 4. 13. to
24 4, 5. to 13. 20. to 22. 6. 20. to
24, 7. 1. to</hi> 5. 8. the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>In theſe and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note>
the Lord knowing our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
backwardneſſe in true
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29133:192"/>
receiuing, and keeping his word,
(which yet is ſo neceſſary, as that
there is no ſaluation without it)
doth make ſo many pretious
promiſes, as I know not whether
to any thing more; That at leaſt
by ſome of them, we, who bee ſo
full of doubting how wee may
attaine to the right vſe of the
word, may be more heartened to
a conſcionable and conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
vnto it, that ſo we may
in due ſeaſon reape the ſweete
fruit thereof.</p>
            <p>This then muſt be the care and
labour of euery one, who feeles
the want of this comfortable vſe
of Gods word, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
it, to bee well acquainted
with theſe promiſes, and out of
all to gather ſome of the chiefe,
ſuch as ſeeme to him moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and ſo commit them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that whenſoeuer he goeth
to the word, he may meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe, and ſo be more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to attend vnto Gods word
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29133:192"/>
with expectation of Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vpon his labour.</p>
            <p>The want of this meditation
vpon Gods promiſes when wee
goe to the word, is one chiefe
cauſe of that great ſinne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
hearing, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that little growth in grace,
which is euery where to be ſeene
among ordinary reſorters to the
publike miniſtery; as the Apoſtle
reporteth of the Hebrewes, that
the <hi>Word preached did not profite
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>being not mingled with faith
in them that heard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of this which hath beene
ſaide of the word in generall,<note place="margin">Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note>
(which well may bee referred to
all the ſeuerall exerciſes therein,
publike or priuate, to euery of
which many of theſe promiſes
doe pertaine) we may ſafely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort in the vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
which be truely called
a viſible Word, becauſe that
which is ſpoken in the word to
the eare, is in viſible ſignes
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:29133:193"/>
repreſented to our eyes, &amp; ſealed
to our hearts, that wee may bee
the more aſſured of them to bee
ours; ſo that if wee had no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
promiſes made expreſly to
them, yet wee might out of the
former receiue ſufficient encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to looke for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of them: that is, to be made
partakers of Chriſt and life in
him; which is the ſumme and
ſubſtance of all that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the word.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord, (who in
all ages of his Church ordained
theſe holy ſignes and ſeales of his
Teſtament, in which he bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
Chriſt and all his benefits to
true beleeuers, and their ſeede,)
knowing our great weakeneſſe
of faith in receiuing theſe ſeales,
hath ſo laboured to giue vs aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that (if wee thinke there
is any truth in him) we may bee
as ſure that Chriſt and al his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are ours, as the outward
ſignes which we ſee with oureies,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29133:193"/>
and our hands doe handle: let vs
for our comfort carefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hereof.</p>
            <p>Not to meddle with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of the olde Teſtament,
<hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi>
both which were to the people of
God ſure <hi>ſeales of the righteouſnes
of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> and doth as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to all the Sacraments
of the olde and new Teſtament:
this one Scripture might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
aſſure any, that hee truely
receiuing the outward ſeales ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods appointment,
ſhould as certainly bee partaker
of Chriſt and all his benefites,
(which are the things ſealed) as he
is partaker of the outward ſeals:
the certainty whereof depends
on Gods truth and faithfulneſſe,
as in his word, ſo in the ſeales
thereof; who doth as truely giue
that which he promiſeth and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
as hee doth freely giue any
promiſe or ſeale.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:29133:194"/>
We doe iuſtly account him no
honeſt man, who will not bee as
good as his word; much more
him who will ſeale a couenant,
and yet not performe it.</p>
            <p>Be it farre off then, from any
Chriſtian to impute this to God,
that hee giues vaine words and
ſeales, and doth not as truely
giue that which hee promiſeth
and ſealeth.</p>
            <p>But the ſole cauſe why many
who come to the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,<note place="margin">Why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profite not by the word &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note>
are not partakers in
them of Chriſt, who is truely on
Gods part offered in them, is this;
That they doe not inwardly by
faith receiue that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
and ſealed, as they do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
receiue the word and
ſeale.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be our wiſedome then
whenſoeuer we goe to the word
and Sacraments, ſpecially to
labour for faith, that thereby we
may as truely receiue Chriſt in
them offered, as wee doe receiue
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29133:194"/>
outwardly the word and ſeales
thereof.</p>
            <p>For the receiuing of the word
we haue ſaid enough.</p>
            <p>Now for our Sacraments,<note place="margin">Few profite by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> I
cannot ſufficiently bewaile the
vniuerſall abuſe of them, which
is ſo grieuous, that they being by
God in loue left to his Church, as
a ſpeciall meanes to further their
ſaluation; ſo many are by their
vnworthy receiuing of them,
made more guilty of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which comes to paſſe, not
onely by that groſſe prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which is in all carnall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
who onely for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
Law, or credit, come to the
Sacraments, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or conſcience:</p>
            <p>2. But in many of ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort, who haue ſome care for
their ſoules, there is either ſuch
ignorance, or negligence, that
they neuer did worthily receiue
the holy ſeales: and therefore
neuer found the ſweete fruites of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:29133:195"/>
3. Yea (that which is more
to bee lamented) this may bee
found in not a few of thoſe who
haue receiued true grace, and bee
indeed Gods children, to whom
onely theſe ſeales of right do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long:
yet theſe ſeldome or neuer
attaine that comfort by the holy
Sacraments, which indeede they
ought and might, were not the
fault in themſelues.</p>
            <p>For proofe hereof, I require
euery one, who would ſee the
truth of this complaint, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelfe in this queſtion,
what ſenſible good hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by his Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>For my part I haue demanded
this queſtion of many (who were
of good eſteeme in the Church)
who had litle to ſay in this point;
and I make no doubt, but the
like may bee found in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who are to ſeeke in this
matter; ſo farre off bee they from
enioying that great gaine, which
is to be got hereby: which in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:29133:195"/>
conſiſts in theſe two, firſt,
that by our baptiſme we be more

<hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, it's often heard to
bee the complaint of many a

God conſtantly, and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in their health and quiet
eſtate, yet when ſickneſſe came
and other croſſes, they were
diſquieted, vnſetled, and could
not goe on, as in times of peace
and quietneſſe. And ſome good
reaſon heereof there may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged,
that howſoeuer the
principal end of afflictions (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the children of God)
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29133:200"/>
is to make them better euery
way; yet by reaſon of naturall
infirmitie, which is ſo loath to
ſuffer and can ſo hardly beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
affliction; they cannot get
their minds and hearts to be fit
to any Chriſtian duty, no not to
prayer, as at ſome other time of

bee prouoked to fretting,
impatience, murmuring; yea in

and ſeeking many vnlawfull
ſhifts to get out of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
theſe with ſundry the
like, be the hurts which come
by afflictions, when we be not
well armed to beare them, and
inſtructed how to make the
right vſe of them. By all which
we may ſee, what neede we haue
to bee ſtrengthened againſt all
the diſcouragements, and other
hinderances: we meete withall
in afflictions;<note place="margin">No helpe but by faith.</note> which wee ſhall
plainly ſee, can by no other
meanes bee attained, then by
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29133:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith; whereby we may boldly
reſt vpon God for his direction
and aſſiſtance, how to beare and
profite by all our afflictions of
what ſort ſoeuer. This is that
which now I vndertake to ſhew;
how we may liue by faith in all
afflictions, ſo as they ſhall in no
ſort hinder vs in our courſe of
Chriſtianitie, but rather further
vs, till we attaine vnto the end
our courſe in Gods kingdome.
Wherein I intend to ſay leſſe
then otherwiſe I would, for that
ſince I tooke this work in hand,
I haue light vpon a Treatiſe of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bifield,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bifield</hi> of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> called <hi>The Promiſes:</hi>
wherein he ſhewes both plainly
and ſoundly, how a godly
Chriſtian may ſupport his heart
with comfort, againſt all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
which by reaſon of any
afflictions, or temptations can
befall him in this life. To
which Treatiſe, I referre all
who deſire to be further ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this matter. But ſeeing I
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29133:201"/>
had (before I ſaw his booke)
gathered out of the Scriptures,
both thoſe promiſes, and many
moe concerning afflictions; I
will proceede as I haue begun,
to ſhew the vſe of faith in all
manner of outward afflictions,
belonging to this naturall life;
how we may be armed to beare
them patiently, and made able to
profite by them.<note place="margin">Of inward troubles in the three former points.</note> For inward and
ſpirituall troubles of minde,
which ariſe from doubts of
Gods fauour, and of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt, as alſo of ſuch
griefes as riſe from our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
either vnableneſſe to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our ſinnes: or very weake
performance of all holy duties;
I haue ſufficiently ſpoken
in the three former generall
heads of this Treatiſe, how we
are to liue by faith in all of theſe.
Therefore heere onely I intend
to gather out of the Scriptures,
ſuch ſweete comforts, as God
hath plentifully ſet downe for
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:29133:202"/>
our comfort in all the outward
croſſes,<note place="margin">Now of outward.</note> whereto we be ſubject,
while we liue heere in this vale
of teares, that ſo we may better
hold out vnto the end.</p>
            <p>In ſetting downe whereof,<note place="margin">Order in handling afflictions.</note> to
keepe ſome order, for our better
helpe in making vſe of them.
Our firſt ground of comfort,<note place="margin">1.</note>
ariſeth from hence, that all our
afflictions come directly from
God, by what meanes ſoeuer.
The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2.</note> to obſerue in
what manner the Lord doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
vs his children, that is, moſt
wiſely in all reſpects, and moſt
louingly.<note place="margin">3.</note> The third, to what
ends, namely his owne glory:
example to others, and our own
good.<note place="margin">4.</note> The laſt is, that hee will
both helpe vs in them, and giue
vs a good end of them. For the
firſt, that all our afflictions come
from God, as the ſupreme judge
and diſpoſer of them, needs not
ſo much proofe of the truth of
it, as due conſideration to make
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:29133:202"/>
the right vſe of it. It is ſaid by the
Prophet,<note place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Shall there be euill in a
City, &amp; the Lord hath not done it;</hi>
meaning of the euill of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not of ſinne; further, then
it is a puniſhment of ſinne. So
likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Hoſea 6. 1.
Come let vs returne vnto the
Lord, for he hath torne, and he will
heale vs; he hath ſmitten, and he
will binde vs vp.</hi> And this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in that common ſpeech.
<hi>The chaſtening of the Lord;</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vſed, eſpecially <hi>Heb. 12. 5.
&amp;c</hi> In which one Scripture be
contained many ſpeciall conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
againſt all manner of
afflictions, as we ſhall ſee euery
one in his place: heere onely
I would joyne this with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
that as all the afflictions
which Gods children doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
come from the hand of
God,<note place="margin">Afflictions bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> ſo hee ſpareth none of
them, but as it is ſaid, <hi>verſe 6. He
ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth,</hi>
and verſe 7. <hi>What ſonne
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29133:203"/>
is he, whom the father correcteth
not;</hi> and more to like effect both
there and elſe-where.<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Both
which, that all our afflictions
come from God, and that hee
dealeth ſo with all his children,
may miniſter much comfort
vnto vs in all our afflictions;
firſt, ſeeing what God doth,
muſt needs be good, how euill
and bitter ſoeuer it ſeemes to vs:
<hi>Yea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 9.</note> 
               <hi>wee muſt hold our peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath done it.</hi> Although
we cannot ſee any reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet we may be ſure the Lord
doth neuer correct his children,
but he ſeeth iuſt cauſe ſo to doe.
As the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> plainly
profeſſeth:<note place="margin">Pſal 119. 75.</note> 
               <hi>I know oh Lord that
thy iudgements are right, and that
thou in faithfulneſſe haſt afflicted
mee.</hi> But more, ſeeing God
who correcteth vs is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we may much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
our hearts in all that hee
ſends, that he will neuer ſend
any croſſe, but ſuch as ſhall bee
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29133:203"/>
for our good, as we ſhall more
ſee. And ſeeing this is no other
then ſuch, as befals the reſt of
Gods children. As the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth, ſaying.<note place="margin">1. Pet 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Knowing
that the ſame afflictions are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in your brethren that are in
the world.</hi> Yea more, ſeeing God
did not ſpare his owne Sonne,
but he was <hi>a man of ſorrowes and
acquainted with griefe. Yea ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of God and afflicted, as</hi> Eſa.
53. 3, 4. Theſe ſhould much
more make vs willing to beare
the croſſe, yea and much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſeeing it is the way to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as more heereafter.</p>
            <p>But this will yet be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
for our conſolation in
all troubles,<note place="margin">In what manner God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth his, in Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Loue.</note> if we ſhall aduiſedly
waigh in what manner God
dealeth with his children,
when he corrects them, which
as it is euery way and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
very well, ſo this may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
be ſeene in theſe two:
In wiſedome, and loue, both
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:29133:204"/>
which well regarded, will make
vs much more willing to beare
any thing at Gods hand, and to
looke for ſome good iſſue out
of all the afflictions which hee
ſhall lay vpon vs. Although
thoſe two diuine properties in
God be vnſeparably ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in all his dealings with
his owne children.<note place="margin">Both ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Yet, it ſhall
much more increaſe our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in any affliction which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falles
vs, to conſider them apart:
and firſt that wee may behold
how wiſely God ordereth the
matter in all his chaſti ſements
vpon his owne children.<note place="margin">Moſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſufficiently be ſeene
in theſe two.<note place="margin">With meet corrections in iuſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> Firſt that God doth
chaſtiſe his with moſt meete
corrections: and ſecondly, in
iuſt meaſure. The fitneſſe of
Gods correction ſtands in this,
that God knoweth all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
both when and how
to chaſtiſe his children, and ſo
accordingly diſpenſeth this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29133:204"/>
Phyſicke, as he ſeeth moſt
fit for the good of the patient,
and qualitie of the diſeaſe. This
me thinkes may be well gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of that compariſon,
which the holy Ghoſt makes
betweene our naturall parents,
and our ſpirituall Father in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
their children, ſaying:
<hi>Furthermore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>we haue had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of our fleſh which corrected
vs, and we gaue them reuerence:
ſhall we not much rather be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to the Father of our ſpirits
and liue. For they verily, for a few
dayes chastiſed vs after their owne
pleaſure, but hee for our profit,
that we might be partakers of his
holineſſe.</hi> Wherein beſides other
differences, this is manifeſt, that
earthly parents, oft correct their
children after their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to ſatisfie their will, not ſo
reſpecting wiſely, what might
be euery way beſt for them: but
God our heauenly Father, in
great wiſdome conſidereth with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:29133:205"/>
what correction, and when to
chaſtiſe his, ſo as may be moſt
for their profite; yea the beſt
profite, to repaire his Image of
holineſſe in them, which is a
chiefe end and vſe of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as wee ſhall hereafter ſee.
This wiſedome of God in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing
his children, may cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſeene in the hiſtories of all
ages of the Church. Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is that of the children of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 37. 28.</note>
who mooued with enuy,
ſold <hi>Ioſeph</hi> their brother into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
and deceiued their old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">verſe 33. 42</note>
who thought that an euill
beaſt had deuoured him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Lord holding his peace
for many yeares, they were qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
all was well. But afterward
the Lord tooke a fit ſeaſon and
meanes to make them ſee their
ſinne, namely, by their brother
<hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who (though they knew
him not) roughly handled
them, accuſed them for ſpies,
caſt them into priſon, and many
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:29133:205"/>
other waies ſorely grieued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
then their guiltie conſciences
could make them confeſſe their
ſinne, and ſay. <hi>We are verily guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
concerning our brother, in that
we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoule,
when he beſought vs, and we would
not heare: therefore is this diſtreſſe
come vpon vs.</hi> And another time
<hi>Iudah</hi> confeſſed to <hi>Ioſeph, what
ſhall we ſay vnto my Lord? what,
ſhall we ſpeake? God hath found
out the iniquitie of thy ſeruants.</hi>
The like courſe did the Lord
take with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 15.</note> in correcting
his grieuous ſinnes in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and by the fact of <hi>Abſolon,</hi>

Amos</hi> 8. 11. The ſame might
we ſee in Gods dealings with

them. When we ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29133:206"/>
on any thing too much,
whereby our hearts be ſtolne
from God, whether they bee

Lord, either to take them from
vs, or to make them bitter vnto
vs, that wee may leſſe eſteeme
them, and haue our hearts free
for better things.</p>
            <p>The comfort which we are
to take by this wiſe dealing of
God with vs,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is this, that as we
know all afflictions to Gods
children, to be Phyſicke, to cure
their corruptions; ſo knowing
alſo they all come from ſo wiſe
&amp; skilfull a Phyſician who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
erre, but alwaies ſends ſuch
Phyſicke, and in ſuch ſeaſon, as
ſhall ſurely doe vs good. This
muſt make vs not onely quietly
to beare them, but to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God for them, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be the better by them.</p>
            <p>But this will more appeare, if
we ſhall well conſider Gods
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:29133:207"/>
wiſedome, in moderating all

for the ſtrength of the patient,
and qualitie of the diſeaſe: both
which may be ſhewed in all the

vpon all his children, though
he chaſtiſe ſome much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercly
and holdeth the rod lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
vpon them, then vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who either haue not ſo
much prouoked the Lord, or
be not ſo able to beare the hand
of the Lord. This is plainely
taught by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13</note> ſaying,
<hi>There hath no tentation taken you,
but ſuch as is common to man. But
God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer
you to be tempted aboue that you
are able but will with the tentati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
make way to eſcape, that ye may
be able to beare it.</hi> In which one
ſentence, we haue theſe ſpeciall
incouragements, to beare ſuch
afflictions, as God our heauenly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:29133:207"/>
Father ſhall lay vpon vs; firſt,
that God deales no otherwiſe
with vs then with others, euen
of his owne children (whereof
before;) ſecondly, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ouer-loadeth his, but wiſely
moderateth the burthen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

it. And this he doth according
to promiſe moſt faithfully: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

begged of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 1</note> that he would
not correct them in his anger,<note place="margin">Iere. 10. 24</note>
neither chaſten them in his hot

the ſame. Memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
hereof all the ſtories of
the Church ſet forth vnto vs in
all ages, among which that is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in the Booke of Martyrs,
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Lawrence Saunders,</hi> who
in the beginning of the Raigne
of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> ſeeing the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Religion, manifeſted
his great feare to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vnto Doctour <hi>Penington,</hi>
who being a big fat man, ſaid,
he would ſee every drop of his
greaſe molten, before he would
forſake the truth. Yet after he
ſhamefully yeelded, and maſter
<hi>Saunders</hi> conſtantly profeſſed
the truth, and ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
very chearefully.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Godly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged by the world.</note> as by theſe trialls, the
faithfull grow to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:29133:218"/>
better, which is of good
vſe: ſo on the other ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is the common lot of Gods
people, to be hardly thought on,
&amp; by many worldlings thought
to be no better then themſelues.
But as Sathan accuſed <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 9. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that
he did not ſerue God for nought,</hi>
and that if he ſhould afflict him
hee <hi>would curſe God to his face,</hi>
ſo ſay they, if theſe profeſſours
(as they in reproch call them)
were in ſuch caſe as others, in
great diſtreſſe be, you ſhould
ſoone ſee what they would doe
I warrant you, they would be as
impatient and take as bad cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſhift for themſelues as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe. But when God calls
forth his children to ſore trialls,
as ſpecially to Martyrdome, to
ſuffer patiently and with rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
great torments, then the
world is conſtrained to confeſſe
as the <hi>Centurion</hi> did of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Luc. 23. 47.</note>
               <hi>Certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y this was a righteous man.</hi>
So then we ſee this one juſt
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:29133:219"/>
cauſe of comfort in our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that by theſe trialls as God
hath the glory of his graces in
vs, we haue the better proofe
and comfort of them, and others
be conſtrained to conceiue and
ſpeake better of vs. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
we are bound better to
beare them, and to bleſſe God
for them.</p>
            <p>Another ſpeciall benefit which
we reape by all kind of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is this,<note place="margin">Second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, is to purge ſin</note> that they be made by
Gods bleſſing effectuall means
to purge out that ſinful corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which growes in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
vnleſſe by theſe and other
like meanes it be daily purged
out; In which reſpect afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
moſt aptly be compared to
Medicines, for ſo indeed they
are to all Gods children, moſt
ſoveraigne meanes to kill their
ſpirituall diſeaſes, in that they
doe driue them more to ſearch
out their ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make them more
weary of them, and as to ſeeke
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29133:219"/>
pardon for them, ſo more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
to overcome them, all
which be worthy fruits of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
plentifully ſet out vnto
vs in Scripture, both by precept
and practiſe of the faithfull. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common then to
call Gods people to repentance,
which containes all theſe by
Gods judgements either threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or executed.</p>
            <p>That this ought to be, cannot
be denyed, but that we ſhall be
thus purged by our afflictions
is moſt doubted, and therefore
we find not ſuch comfort in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
as otherwiſe we ſhould,
if we might be ſure to reape this
fruit by them for our comfort,
wherein I know not what can
be greater then that which the
Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. Alſo
we know that all things worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for good to them that loue God,
to them that are called according to
his purpoſe;</hi> where, in one word
he ſayth as much as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29133:220"/>
or conceived, that all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
(for of them ſpecially
hee ſpeaketh) how many or
great ſoever they be, ſhall by
Gods bleſſing as meanes by him
appointed, procure and further
our chiefeſt good, that is, the
welfare and happineſſe of our
ſoules, a principall part whereof
is the purging of our ſoules
from ſinne (which is the ſole
cauſe of all our miſery) which
benefit by afflictions, though it
be moſt excellent, yet it is no
leſſe ſure and certaine, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the Apoſtles owne
words, ſaying <hi>(we know)</hi> that is,
not onely I and you, but all the
faithfull people of God, haue
good proofe of it by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and therefore cannot
doubt of it, that all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall turne to our good,
which becauſe it is (in time of
ſore afflictions) ſo hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
            <p>I will make it manifeſt by one
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29133:220"/>
vndeniable reaſon, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwiſe be but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
befalleth Gods children,
ſhall moſt certainely make for
their good. Which is this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God did from all eternitie of
his own good will chooſe them
to be heires of glory, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that all things which ſhould
befall them, ſhould ſerue to that
end, then whatſoever comes to
them ſhall turne to this their
chiefe good, otherwiſe God
ſhould either change his will, or
be not able to doe that which he
determined to doe, neither of
which can in any ſort be ſaid of
God, and therefore it cannot
poſſibly be, that any affliction
vpon Gods children ſhould
turne to their hurt, but all of
them muſt needs turne to their
good. This one Scripture (if
there were no more) may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
aſſure vs hereof, and ſo
perſwade vs, more contentedly
to beare them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:29133:221"/>
But as this doth more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſet out the fruit of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
ſo in other places this fruit
of purging vs from our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is more ſpecially declared,
as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. like to that before
of <hi>Dan. 11. 35. Many ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
made white, and tryed.</hi> So
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 25. the Prophet denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Gods fearefull judgements
againſt the wicked rebellious
Iewes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. addeth this as a
bleſſing to the Church; <hi>And I
will turne my hand vpon thee, and
purely purge away thy droſſe, and
take away all thy ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> meaning
their droſſe of ſinne, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the purer metall of grace.
And to like effect, Chap. 27. ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth Gods different dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with his beloued, aboue
their wicked enemies in their
afflictions, adds this in <hi>verſ. 9. By
this therefore ſhall the iniquitie of
Iacob be purged, and this is all the
fruit to take away his ſinne.</hi> This
alſo is part of that which is ſayd
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29133:221"/>
of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. 2.</note> that <hi>euery
branch which beareth fruit, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
it that it may bring more fruit.</hi>
And how ſhould Gods chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vs, keepe vs that we be not
condemned,<note place="margin">1 Cor 11. 32.</note> if it did not weaken
our ſinnes, the ſole cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
But I will ſpare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe places to this purpoſe, as
<hi>Prou. 20. 30. Pſal. 119. 67 71.
Eſa.</hi> 4. 4. &amp;c. I will onely ſhew
thet ruth heereof in a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for many; moſt famous

               <hi>he

him, and he was intreated of him
and heard his ſupplication &amp;c.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which followes how many
things he reformed. Which is a
ſpeciall example of this fruit of
afflictions, the more to ſtir vs vp
to looke for the like. The ſame
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:29133:222"/>
may beſeene in the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Pſal. 32. and els where oft.</p>
            <p>But to leaue all particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in whom this is to be ſeene
that by their afflictions they
were brought to repentance. It
is obſerued to be the ordinary
practiſe of Gods people in their
afflictions, to ſeeke to God in
prayer, and to turne from their
ſinne,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 8. 35.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhews in his
prayer to God. And <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 16.
profeſſeth the like, ſaying; <hi>Lord

they powred out a prayer when thy

God himſelfe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. ſayth
no leſſe; <hi>I will goe and returne to

offence, and ſeeke my face, in their
affliction they will ſeeke me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee this point ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved, that afflictions be
ſpeciall means to purge vs from
ſin, in which regard they ſhould
be more welcome vnto vs, and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:29133:222"/>
not ſo vnkindly entertained as
vſually they be.</p>
            <p>But before we make further

briefly manifeſt the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and let vs ſee what helpes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
be by Gods bleſſing
vpon them, to quicken and ſtir
vp Gods graces in his children.
This is evidently ſayd <hi>Heb. 12.
10.</hi> that whereas <hi>our earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
chaſtened vs after their
owne pleaſure,</hi> God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father chaſteneth vs <hi>for
our profit, that we might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his holineſſe. David,</hi> Pſal.
119. 67. profeſſeth the like of
himſelfe, ſaying; <hi>Before I was
afflicted I went aſtray, but now I
haue kept thy Word.</hi> And verſ. 71.
<hi>It is good for me that I haue beene
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29133:223"/>
afflicted, that I might learne thy
ſtatutes.</hi> Eſa. 26. 9. <hi>When thy
iudgments are vpon the earth, the
inhabitants of the world ſhall learne
righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this is true in the generall
that the faithfull be made better
and more fruitful by afflictions,<note place="margin">Afflictions ſtir vp faith &amp; patience.</note>
ſo this is moſt apparent in faith
and patience, both which be
moſt exerciſed by afflictions,
and the worth of them more
manifeſted, and magnified. For
faith, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 1. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
1. Chap. verſ. 6. 7. excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſets it forth, where in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
verſe in a high degree he
extolleth the exceeding mercies
of God towards all the faithfull
(which although I digreſſe, I
cannot paſſe over, in the deſire
I haue they may be better admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſought after) the words
I will leaue to be pervſed by
ſuch as deſire better to waygh
them.<note place="margin">Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of the elect.</note> The ſpeciall prerogatiues
belonging to all Gods choſen
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29133:223"/>
(of whom he ſpeakes) be theſe;
That they were begotten of
God as to be his children, ſo to
haue a living and never dying
hope, purchaſed vnto them by
the whole mediation of Chriſt,
whereof his riſing from the
dead was a chiefe part. The
chiefe matter hoped for, is an
inheritance, and that no earthly,
one, which is full of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and changes, but a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
which is every way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and pure, and ſo laſteth
without alteration for ever;
whereof, that by no power they
be deprived, its lockt vp and
kept ſafe for them in heaven:
And leaſt themſelues ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
before they ſhould fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it, and take poſſeſſion of it;
They are kept ſafely by Gods
power, applyed vnto them by
faith, till they attaine that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is prepared for them,
and ſhall ſhortly be fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:29133:224"/>
What heart can ſufficiently be
affected, either to deſire theſe or
joy in them as were meet, and
ſo be thankfull for them? yet
this is it whereof the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of theſe beleevers;
<hi>Wherein yee greatly reioyce, though
now for a ſeaſon (if need be) yee
are in heavineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>through manifold
temptations:</hi>
               <note place="margin">7.</note> 
               <hi>That the triall of your
faith, being much more precious
then of gold that periſheth, though
it be tried with fire, might be found
vnto praſye, and honour and glory,
at the appearing of Chriſt.</hi> In
which Scripture, this one thing
is cleare, that the great worth of
faith is made manifeſt by the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
triall of afflictions, ſo that
faith is as much advanced by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
as gold by fire.</p>
            <p>This ſhall ſuffice in a caſe ſo
common, in the practiſe of the
faithfull in all ages, whoſe faith
hath beene made famous by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
Take onely the whole
11. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> for
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:29133:224"/>
a patterne, wherein is at large
layd out, how the faith of Gods
people in all ages was made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
by afflictions. The life of
<hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> Eſpecially I may
not forget that worthy ſervant
of God the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe
whole life, after his converſion,
was full of ſore affliction, yet
where did we ever heare of
greater faith? So that as great
Battels ſet out the valour of a
worthy Captaine or Souldier,
and great ſtormes the goodnes
of the Ship and Anchor, and
skill of the Maſter; ſo doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
commend the faith of
true Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew how afflictions
be ſpeciall meanes to invre to
patience,<note place="margin">Patience.</note> I need not ſay much,
ſeeing patience is the daughter,
and an vnſeperable companion
of faith, as is worthily ſet downe
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. I onely cite
<hi>verſ.</hi> 3. where he ſayth; <hi>That we
doe not onely ſo (reioyce in hope of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29133:225"/>
the glory of God) But we glory in
tribulations alſo, knowing that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
worketh patience, &amp;c.</hi>
To like effect is that <hi>Iames 1. 2.
3. My brethren count it all ioy
when yee fall into divers temptati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.
Knowing this that the trying
of your faith worketh patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will content my ſelfe with
theſe two witneſſes as good as
twentie, which in this caſe may
ſoone be brought, and ſo will
come to make our vſe of all
theſe three benefits by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
1. That they be ſent from
God, to be trialls to diſcover to
our ſelues and others, godly and
wicked, what ſtrength of grace
and ſinne doth remaine in vs,
which is many waies profitable.
2. To be effectuall purgations
to waſt and weaken thoſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
corruptions which moſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our ſoules health. 3. And
laſtly to quicken all ſaving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in vs, and ſo every way to
make vs better, both to glorifie
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29133:225"/>
God in this life, and to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of him in the life to come.</p>
            <p>The leaſt of all which fruits of
afflictions,<note place="margin">Vſe of all theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> though it went alone
(if the profit and comfort it
bringeth might be well priſed)
would moue any good heart,
(if lawfully they might) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
afflictions, at leaſt to be glad
of them, when the Lord our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Father, and wiſe Phyſitian
doth ſend them to vs, how
much more then when as all
theſe ſhall be joyned together,
ſhould we rejoyce and bleſſe
God for them. There is no good
Chriſtian, but he greatly deſires
to be more humbled in the ſight
of his manifold ſinnes, and to be
comforted with the ſweet fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Gods graces in him.
Yea, much more deſires he to be
purged from theſe ſpirituall
corruptions, which take away
his ſtomacke and ſtrength, that
he can neither feed nor worke
as his place requires. And aboue
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:29133:226"/>
all doth he covet ſpirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that he might ſhine out in a
godly life to the honour of his
profeſſion, the winning of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
and making ſure his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and election. All which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they be procured by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and hardly or never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them (as that place 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.
18. proveth; <hi>And if the righteous
be ſcarcely ſaved.</hi> And this is the
chiefe cauſe why none of Gods
children are without them, as
<hi>Heb. 12. 6. 7. 8.)</hi> me thinkes
there is great reaſon why we
ſhould be thankfull to God for
them; and ſo labour to reape
this fruit by them, that we may
ſay and ſing with the Pſalmiſt,
(as it is ſweetly expreſſed in the
Meeter) <hi>O h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cauſe haue Gods children to
thinke their condition miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe of afflictions, that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:29133:226"/>
if we will beleeue and practiſe
what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed
and performed, we muſt in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner boaſt of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note>
as a Souldier of his ſcarres
got in battell. And as a little
before we heard,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> did take

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
Chriſts ſake.</hi> Thus we ſee what
comfort we may get out of <hi>Gods</hi>
Word, fitly applyed vnto vs by
faith, for the better bearing of all
afflictions of what ſort ſoever.
I might gather many other
fruits of afflictions, as ſome haue
done, but if all be well wayghed
they may be referred to one of
theſe three, and ſo having ſayd
ſufficient of the three former
grounds of comfort in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>I will come to the fourth and
laſt,<note place="margin">The fourth ground of comfort in afflictions.</note> which is to ſet out what
helpe God hath promiſed vs in
all our troubles, that we may be
able to beare them; and in due
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:29133:227"/>
ſeaſon to giue vs a good iſſue
out of them. Concerning
which it will be profitable to
obſerue, that the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our great weaknes to beare
the croſſe, and how full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
we be, that God will not
be ready to helpe vs, at leaſt as
we would, (both which are ſo
often to be found in the liues of
Gods faithfull ſervants in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as needs no further proofe)
the Lord, I ſay, well acquainted
with this frailtie of his children,
hath moſt plentifully provided
all ſufficient helpe to ſupport
them, and therefore made ſo
many promiſes to be with them
in all their troubles, and ſuccour
them in all extremities, that they
ſhall never periſh, but in the end
find a good end and iſſue out of
them, to his glory, and their
endleſſe comfort.</p>
            <p>Having pervſed theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and gathered them out of
the Scripture, I may boldly ſay
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:29133:227"/>
they doe farre exceed in number
all the former, ſo that it would
be too tedious to ſet them down
all, I will therefore make choice
of ſome of the chiefe, that we
may haue them ready for our
vſe againſt time of need.</p>
            <p>Among all that is exceeding
full of comfort which is written,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. In which chapter, the
Apoſtle intending to teach, that
nothing ſhould hinder the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of thoſe that be in Chriſt,
whereas there be but theſe two,
corruption and affliction, hee
firſt confutes the one, from <hi>verſe

               </gap>7. and ſecondly the other
concerning afflictions, from
<hi>verſe</hi> 17. to 31. And whereas it
might be obiected, that though
afflictions were profitable to
thoſe that could endure them,
yet oft they be ſo heauie that we
cannot ſo much as cry to God
for helpe as we ought: hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that even then <hi>the ſpirit hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peth

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:29133:228"/>
that when we begin to ſincke as
not able to ſtand vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
then Gods Spirit puts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand to ſupport vs.
Which is in ſo many words ſaid

ſhall not vtterly be caſt downe, for

Gods helpe one way or other,
either to rid vs out of our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or make vs, quietly to

               </gap>e them, ſo long as ſhal ſeem
good to his heavenly wiſedome
to continue them. For which

his Diſciples of many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 15. 16.</note>
which ſhould befall
them in the worlde, among

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:29133:228"/>
them, that in the world
they ſhould haue tribulation,
he bids them <hi>bee of good cheare
for hee hath overcome the World.</hi>
Likewiſe the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3
4. to hearten the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
indure all troubles, calleth God
the God of all comfort, who
comforted him and all others in

might be able to comfort others
which are in any trouble.</hi> The
like is to be ſeene almoſt in all
the holy Epiſtles, in which the
Saints be incouraged to ſuffer
afflictions patiently.</p>
            <p>But to proceede, exceeding
many be the places in which
God promiſeth to his people
that he wil be a ſure and ſpeedy
help in all troubles, in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

leaue nor forſake them, but will
be a preſent helpe in time of

comforts, both outward helpes
and inward graces to ſupport
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:29133:231"/>
them, and in the end will one
way or other fully ſet them free,
and quite deliver them out of
all their feares and troubles: we
may ſee what ſmall cauſe wee
haue to be diſcouraged by our
afflictions, or to fret and repine
at them: yea rather wee haue
moſt iuſt cauſe to reioyce in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to bleſſe God for them, and to
labour both to beare them and
to profit by them, that God may
haue glory thereby, our ſelues
may reape the benefit by them,
and others may profit by our
example. And thus laying all
together which hath beene ſayd
of afflictions, we ſhall find that
they be no lets, but ſpecial helps
as to godlineſſe in this life, ſo
to happines in the life to come.
Thus much for this fourth
point how to liue by faith in all

all earthly bleſſings, how we

that ſo, well conſidering what

faithfull who hath promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
ſhall not want any earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
at what time, and in what
meaſure it ſhall be good for vs.
Theſe generall promiſes of all
good things for this life, are the
more to be obſerved in reading
the Scriptures, and (at leaſt
ſome of the moſt principall in
our conceit) to be kept in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that they may be ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

when we haue moſt need of
them.</p>
            <p>And this might be ſufficient

            <p>Among all earthly bleſſings,<note place="margin">Long life.</note>
life it ſelfe is the chiefe; for vpon

himſelfe who is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:29133:237"/>
could ſay; <hi>All that a man hath
will he giue for his life:</hi> for this
cauſe the Lord the more to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

make ſo many promiſes of long
life, and many dayes; as in the

muſt be the vſe we are to make

call to mind ſome of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and ſo reſt our ſelues qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly

therevpon, that none of
theſe, nor any thing els ſhould
ſhorten the dayes of our life,
more then ſhould turne to our
greater good. Yea, further ſeeing
the Lord hath made it ſo great
an encouragement to feare and
ſerue him, as if he had not a
greater reward in matters of this
life, to beſtow vpon his faithfull
ſervants, (and ſo the faithfull
haue in all ages eſteemed it, and
deſired it,<note place="margin">Eſa. 39. 19.</note> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi>
oftentimes:<note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 4.</note> yea, and many of

it as they did (which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(to ſay no more) quite croſſeth
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29133:239"/>
this wiſedome and goodnes of
God, in promiſing life to his
beſt ſervants, as a chiefe reward
of their good ſervice) let vs then
ſo account of long life as a rich
bleſſing, which makes all other
bleſſings of this life the more
excellent, and vſefull, both to
God and man, to our ſelues and
others: and the want hereof the
quite contrary, as may be eaſily

doth it abate the vſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

of all excellent gifts of
the mind, or body: if theſe be
nipt off in the bud, and not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
to come to full ripenes, &amp; ſo
to continue to their full terme
and end. Let vs then (I ſay) ſo
accept theſe promiſes, that in all
time of need we may ſtay our
ſelues vpon them, and that we
may find comfort in all tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the contrary.</p>
            <p>This being the firſt and chiefe

bleſſing of this life, <hi>Long life,</hi> I
meane, if this ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with health, wealth,

would make long life more
weariſome then welcome vnto

            <p>For this cauſe God is not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

doth the Lord paſſe his word
vnto vs, that his ſpirit ſhall abide

            <p>
               <hi>By this did our Saviour Chriſt

            <p>And this I will adde, for the

and thereby be ſtirred vp to be

mercy, that they ſhall ſtand,
when others fall, and take this
withall, that then we be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
when we be weakeſt, that
is, when feeling our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and diſtruſting our ſelues,
we run to God, and relie vpon
him in all our neceſſities; which
is that I haue laboured to effect
in all this treatiſe. The ſumme
whereof I will in few words ſet
downe, as for the helpe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
ſo for the quickning of
our ſpirits more to labour for
this happie life by faith, which
both in life and death will be
our chiefe comfort.</p>
            <p>For ſo much as the liues and
deaths of the moſt profeſſours
of Chriſtian Religion, doe ſhew
that few attaine either that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſalvation, or conſcience
of holy converſation, which <hi>God</hi>
hath prepared for true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
My maine ſcope hath bin
to redreſſe this ſore evill, and to
this end I haue ſhewed that this
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:29133:261"/>
bleſſedneſſe is enjoyed onely by
living by faith, and what ſaving
faith is, how its gotten, and how
we may know that we haue it,
both by the cauſes and effects,
ioyned together not ſeperated.
Wherein ſeeing many be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on either ſide, ſome preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
others miſtruſting, there
be plaine markes of ſoundneſſe
ſet downe, whereby every one
may try himſelfe.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are taught
how to liue by faith: herein
what it is to <hi>liue by faith,</hi> and
how this is obtained, which is
by due application of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
whereto is required ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meditation, and prayer,
wherin ſeeing few be ſo fervent,
as in this caſe ought to be, the
ſingular gaine hereof is largely
layd downe, both for conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for reformation of our
liues; and herein foure rules,
which be of excellent vſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:29133:262"/>
is a direction how to apply
to our particular neceſſities <hi>Gods</hi>
promiſes, which being of divers
ſorts, abſolute, or conditionall,
ſimply neceſſary, or with limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
generall or ſpeciall, are all
accordingly to be conſidered.
All of theſe being ſo exceeding
many to bring them to ſome ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
order, for our better vſe of
them all, they be drawne to ſix
heads, to which all may be well
referred.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt whereof concernes
the aſſurance of our ſalvation by
Chriſt, herein firſt ſuch generall
promiſes as containe all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the next place is more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſhewed, how we may be
more aſſured by faith of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
in both the parts
thereof, 1. the forgiueneſſe of
ſinne, 2. <hi>the imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>
And likewiſe of the
fruits of theſe, which be 1. our
<hi>Reconciliation,</hi> 2. our <hi>Adoption,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:29133:262"/>
3. hope of glory.</hi> For further proofe
that we be Gods children, we
haue aſſurance by ſenſe, when
we ſee the ſpirit of God working
in vs ſuch graces, as cannot
be in truth in any, but ſuch as
ſhall be ſaved. Among which 1.
<hi>Faith</hi> it ſelfe is chiefe. 2. <hi>The gift
of the ſpirit. 3. Sincere obedience,
4. Promiſes made to many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
graces, as to the loue of God, and
of our neighbour, to the feare of
God.</hi> And ſo to all other fruits
of faith, which be markes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And becauſe many
weake, yet true beleevers, haue
no feeling of their faith, and
thereby be ſore diſcouraged,
there be foure markes of true
faith where it cannot be ſeene.
Sundry other promiſes of Gods
favour to ſtrengthen our faith.</p>
            <p>The ſecond generall head of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
theſe promiſes for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our faith concerneth
the <hi>mortification of our corrupt
nature,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erein our faith being
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:29133:263"/>
ſo weake, we haue manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to aſſure vs of a
full and finall victory. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
promiſes, that <hi>God will
cleanſe vs from all vnrighteouſnes,</hi>
may ſuffice for all particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third generall head of
promiſes, is to aſſure vs of all
needfull grace to lead a godly
life, herein 1. how to obtaine
this grace. 2. to aſſure vs our
weake obedience ſhall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>In what ſpeciall duties in every
Commandement we be moſt
failing. Generall promiſes that
we ſhall want no ſaving grace,
with the right vſe of theſe. For
our further helpe, God hath
made many promiſes of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
graces. 1. <hi>that he will teach vs.
2. that he will ſet our hearts in
frame. 3. that he will giue vs faith,
truſt, hope, ioy,</hi> (which few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to for want of faith) <hi>to loue
and feare him,</hi> with the right vſe
of all. Whereas we fayle much
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:29133:263"/>
in all holy exerciſes, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
he will both aſſiſt vs and
accept vs in them, as in <hi>prayer,
few prayers made in faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to be referred to all
ſpirituall Sacrifices. Whereas
there is much vnfruitfulneſſe
in the exerciſes of the Word
and Sacramants, even in ſuch
as haue true grace, through
want of faith; the remedy is to
apply Gods promiſes (which be
many) eſpecially when they goe
to theſe duties. The Sacraments
be much more abuſed, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is to conſider Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the ſeales.</p>
            <p>The fourth head concerneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
afflictions, whereby many be
diſcouraged, no helpe but by
faith. <hi>Foure grounds of comfort,</hi>
1. All afflictions come from
God, and that to all of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
2. In what manner God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth
his, moſt wiſely &amp; moſt
lovingly, his wiſedome is in the
meetnes of the correction, and
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:29133:264"/>
in the juſt meaſure and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
thereof, Gods loving &amp;
tender dealing with his, is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
ſet out vnto vs for our
comfort. 3. the excellent ends
and fruits of afflictions, generall
is bleſſedneſſe. 3. ſpeciall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
by afflictions, 1. they be <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
of our ſtrength and weakneſſe</hi>
many <hi>iudge amiſſe and be miſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by others.</hi> 2. benefit by afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is, we be purged from our
corruptions. 3. by theſe Gods
graces in vs be quickned, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faith and patience. All which
benefits being ſo deſired, and
not attained without afflictions,
ſhould make vs reioyce in them.
4. comfort in afflictions, God
<hi>will helpe vs and deliver vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fift head, is that we ſhall
not want any earthly bleſſing

them.</p>
            <p>The ſixt and laſt head of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
for our living by faith is
for <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> which being
not onely doubted of, but gaine
ſayd, God hath ſpoken much
for our comfort, on which we
are oft to meditate, that we may
hold out to the end, and ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
we may enioy al thoſe
rich promiſes mentioned in the
ſecond and third chapters of the
<hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of that
which more at large (according
to my poore abilitie) I haue
layd out in this Treatiſe: what
I haue ſought herein, I muſt
leaue to him who knowes and
ſhall judge even my intention,
as well as my actions; what may
bee the profit heereby to Gods
people the effects ſhall ſhew.</p>
            <p>And this I may ſay that had
I not conceived good hope
thereof, I ſhuld never haue ſpent
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:29133:265"/>
ſo many yeares about it. And if
I had not beene much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by ſundry men of good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
in our Church, who
peruſing it, after a ſort charged
me, not to bury my labours,
but to communicate them to
all that will receiue them, mine
owne meane conceit of my ſelfe
and labours, would haue kept
them ſtill cloſe from ſo publike
a view and cenſure.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhut vp all,<note place="margin">Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for faith.</note> I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
beſeech in the Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoule, who truely lamenteth
his want of comfort in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
in all his neceſſities, and
weaknes of obedience in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
required, both which doe
principally ariſe from the want,
and weakneſſe of faith: that they
would <hi>aboue all</hi> (as the Apoſtle
himſelfe exhorteth, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 16)</hi>
labour to get, and ſtriue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this precious grace of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith, in ſuch manner, and
by ſuch meanes, as in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:29133:265"/>
hath beene ſet downe.</p>
            <p>And for the better attaining
herevnto, their owne experience
ſhall ſhew how needfull it ſhall
be to make this a daily practiſe,
to meditate vpon Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſpecially ſuch as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
their preſent condition,
and to this end to commit to
memory,<note place="margin">To learne ſpeciall promiſes.</note> and to learne without
Booke one or two principall
promiſes for every purpoſe as I
haue ſet them downe, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
may obſerue, that ſo they
may haue them readie for their
vſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for example, when they
would goe to Prayer, thinke
ſeriouſly of that promiſe,</hi> Rom. 8
26. Likewiſe the ſpirit alſo helpeth
our infirmities: for we know not
what we ſhould pray for, as we
ought; but the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh
interceſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er vs, with groanings
which cannot be vttered. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27.
And he that ſearcheth the hearts,
knoweth what is the mind of the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:29133:266"/>
ſpirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
for the Saints according to the
will of God. <hi>Or that of</hi> Iames. 1.
5. If any of you lacke wiſedome, let
him aske of God, who giueth libe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally
to all men, and vpbraideth
not: and it ſhall be given him. <hi>I
make no doubt but the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
what God hath ſayd
in either of theſe, will put life
into any Chriſtian heart, more
comfortably to ſet himſelfe to
this holy dutie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like is to be done when
we goe about our callings.</hi>
Pſal. 121. 8. The Lord ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
thy going out, and thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
in, from this time forth and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So when any croſſe befalleth
vs, remember that vnvaluable
promiſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. Alſo we
know that all things worke together
for good, to them that loue God, to
them who are the called, according
to his purpoſe. <hi>And that</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
13. There hath no tentation taken
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:29133:266"/>
you but ſuch as is common to man,
but God is faithfull, who will not
ſuffer you to be tempted aboue that
you be able: but will with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
alſo make a way to eſcape,
that ye may be able to beare it. <hi>The
ſame is to be ſayd for the reſt, as
more largely hath beene hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end I doe adviſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to ſet apart ſome time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day (if there be no juſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance)
to this dutie of nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
their faith,<note place="margin">To ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſome time every day.</note> by prayer, and
meditation on Gods promiſes,
which although I feare it bee
rarely practiſed, yet I dare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to be of admirable gain
to all good purpoſes, and holy
practiſes of Chriſtianitie, even
in dayes of proſperitie, though
more ſpecially in times of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie.</p>
            <p>And herein, the more to ſtirre
vp all who deſire to ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Lord in the land of
the living. I will adde this of
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:29133:267"/>
mine owne experience both in
my ſelfe, and others not a few,
with whoſe ſtate I haue beene
acquainted, that as there can be
no ſound comfort in any part of
our life without faith, &amp; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more hard to keepe in
life, then true faith: ſo this is
the chiefe cauſe, why ſo few find
that good aſſurance of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that comfort in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that power againſt their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
&amp; that growth in grace,
which full well they might, if
the fault were not in themſelues,
for that they doe not make this
a dayly practiſe to examine
themſelues, <hi>whether they bee in
the faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 13 5.</note> (as the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
that ſo finding their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they might bee ſtirred vp
more conſtantly and painefully
to ſtriue for the maintenance
of their faith, whereof they
ſhall haue ſuch dayly vſe, that
without it there can be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
but rather a dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29133:267"/>
in all Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of all which
I make this my laſt ſuite to all
ſuch, onely to make triall of this
dutie of dayly nourſhing and in
creaſing their faith, which if they
ſhall endeavour not ſlightly, but
carefully with knowledge and
conſcience, I make no doubt,
but that they ſhall find, at leaſt
ſo much as ſhal incourage them
to goe forward, till they ſhalbe
further ſatisfied, onely we muſt
referre to God, both the time
when, and the meaſure how
much, it ſhall ſeeme good to his
wiſedome to beſtow on vs.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I will not ceaſe
to pray vnto God for them all,
that he would <hi>fulfill all the good
pleaſure of his goodneſſe and the
worke of faith with power.</hi> So
be it.</p>
